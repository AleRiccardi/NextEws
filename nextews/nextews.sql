The Firefox browser maker said Tuesday that the former civil servant, who oversaw internet policy and cybersecurity towards the end of Obama’s presidential tenure, will return Mozilla in the new role after last year serving as its tech policy fellow. Davidson also served as Google’s policy chief amid an uproar in 2011 about the search giant’s location tracking, and later as director of New America’s Open Technology Institute. In his new role, Davidson will be responsible for Mozilla’s policy, trust and security work, including compliance, security and investigations. Mozilla said that will include the company’s ongoing efforts to defend the open web, such as web standards, net neutrality and pushing for user privacy. Davidson, who said he was “thrilled” to join the browser giant, will report to Mozilla’s chief operating officer, Denelle Dixon. “At a time when people are questioning the impact of technology on their lives and looking for leadership from organizations like Mozilla, Alan will add considerable capacity to our public policy, trust and security efforts, drawing from his extensive professional history working to advance a free and open digital economy,” said Dixon. The browser maker has aggressively pushed for opening data and doubling down on privacy features in recent years. Last week, Mozilla published its Firefox user data in an effort to be more transparent with its telemetry data collection. And, the company recently announced it will soon block trackers that follow users across the web for, among other things, targeted advertising.

The co-working company created the app to connect its members and keep them up to date on The Wing’s programming. For now, the app will only be available to paying Wing members. Founded in 2016, The Wing provides co-working and community space to women. It’s raised $40 million in venture capital backing from top-tier investors like Kleiner Perkins and NEA. WeWork has also noticed the value in The Wing’s female-first model; the co-working behemoth led its $32 million Series B last November. As it stands, the company has just four locations in two states: New York and Washington, DC. A San Francisco location is expected this October, and West Hollywood, London, Toronto, Seattle and Chicago locations are all in the pipeline. To enjoy The Wing’s many perks—brass & millennial pink decor, shelves of color-coordinated books and exclusive access to events featuring Hillary Clinton or New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, for example—it’s not cheap. Wing members pay $215 per month for access to a single location. But compare that to the price of a desk at a San Francisco WeWork, about $400, and it’s not so bad. The Wing also provides lactation rooms, “beauty rooms,” a library, food and drinks, and more. In addition to being founded by two women, Gelman and Lauren Kassan, the company also boasts an all-female staff—a rarity for a company backed by venture capitalists. That includes Lina Dorkhman, who The Wing hired six months ago to lead development on the app. She’d spent the last 3.5 years at BlackRock as an associate. “I was actually a member first and when I saw that they were hiring a product manager I thought it was a perfect fit,” Dorkhman told me. She says The Wing wanted to create a product that recognized women as not only professionals, or parents or friends or siblings, but all of those things. “With products like Linkedin, there is this separation of this is my personal self and my professional self,” Dorkhman said. “What we see at The Wing is there isn’t necessarily a separation of your personal self and your professional self. We want to acknowledge that—that is the future of work. You bring your whole self to work.” The idea for the app stemmed from member feedback, which asked that the company provide more digital components. “We hear from our members that there is this really special feeling of entering The Wing,” Dorkhman added. “That feeling that you get in the physical space is something we really wanted to translate into the product.” ', 'https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/women-only-co-working-space-the-wing-is-launching-an-app-to-help-its-members-stay-connected/', 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-21.png?w=764', '2018-09-04 13:00:07', 208, 1),
(149, 'In GOP, Trump bump has become a tsunami', 'Jack Kingston says it''s clear that a Trump endorsement is the key to victory in GOP primaries, but will it win over the independent voters crucial to winning in November?', 'Jack Kingston, a CNN political commentator, is a Republican from Georgia who served in Congress from 1993 to 2015. He has been a senior adviser to the Trump campaign since 2016 and is a lobbyist in Washington. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.  View more opinion at CNN. (CNN)First South Carolina, then Alabama and Georgia. Now Florida and Arizona. The "Trump Bump" is better described as a tsunami. A month ago, Florida gubernatorial candidate Congressman Ron DeSantis ran a corny but humorous ad about his support of Donald Trump. The ad started with his Emmy-winning TV personality wife, Casey, cheerfully stating, "Everyone knows my husband Ron is endorsed by President Trump...but he''s also an amazing dad." As she speaks, we see Congressman DeSantis teaching his toddler to build a wall, reading Trump bedtime stories and their infant son wearing a MAGA shirt. The left-leaning pundits on  "Morning Joe" bemoaned the ad and seemed baffled by it. The panelists were so disturbed by the ad that not even safe zones on Ivy League campuses could have helped them. But if their thinly veiled disdain for Trump could have been put on hold, they would not have been baffled.  For instance, they could have looked at the South Carolina race between Mark Sanford and Katie Arrington. Mark Sanford said he didn''t see it coming.  He was a seasoned campaigner who knew the challenges of retail politics, but three hours before the polls closed on Election Day, President Trump endorsed Arrington and it was all but over.  Similarly, Congresswoman Martha Roby of Alabama was in a competitive run-off against a former colleague when a Trump endorsement settled the matter.  She won with 68% of the vote. If these races couldn''t convince the critics, there was the gubernatorial run-off in Georgia.  Two well-known, savvy politicians fought their way through a five-way race to a face-off in the final round. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp both had name ID, years of experience, sufficient funding and statewide organizations.  Each had spent over a decade preparing for this contest. Eight days before the election, Cagle won the coveted endorsement of popular incumbent Gov. Nathan Deal. With Deal''s endorsement, his lead jumped in the polls to 2-4% -- a solid position for the home stretch. But campaign trails run on roller coaster tracks, not the flat ovals of horse races.  His time on top lasted three days. "Brian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia. The Primary is on Tuesday. Brian is tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration. He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment. I give him my full and total endorsement." Six days later, Brian Kemp won 157 out of Georgia''s 159 counties.  It was the biggest landslide between two viable candidates in Georgia''s history. In Florida, DeSantis didn''t have to be convinced, he simply put the pedal to the metal. In Arizona, the successful GOP Senate candidate, Rep. Martha McSally moved from being distant to Trump in 2016 to asking him to jump in the cockpit with her. "President Trump has a 90% approval rating with Republican primary voters and two thirds are in the ''strong approve category''" says pollster John McLaughlin.  "After five hundred days into his administration only George HW Bush achieved such numbers.  His was short-lived in the wake of Desert Storm. To win a Republican primary you have be the Trump candidate". However, what''s good in July may be disaster in November. A recent CNN poll shows Democrat base voters have just as much passion - but in the opposite direction.  This of course drives them to the polls but as we saw in the Florida and Arizona gubernatorial races, the most fervent Democratic voters are the Bernie Sanders disciples. This year, candidates in swing districts and statewide races know the age-old dilemma is worse than ever:  To win their respective primaries, their politics must move further to the left for Democrats and further to the right for Republicans than their opponents. But in November their fate is not in the hands of Democrats or Republicans, but with elusive independents. Among Independents, McLaughlin says one third like Trump and his policies and will vote Republican.  Another third dislike Trump. It outweighs their support of his policies and they will vote Democratic. The remaining third is the toughest candidate challenge. They like Trump''s accomplishments but are consumed with negative news and remain undecided. To get these mercurial voters, Chris D''Aniello of Axiom Strategies advises clients not to try to run to the middle but to bring the middle to them by focusing conversations around issues. "You win elections by rallying and growing your base," D''Aniello says. "Focus on winning issues and the radicalization of the opposition. For Republicans -- Does your opponent really think abolishing ICE will make streets safe?" D''Aniello suggests asking if the Democrat they''re opposing agrees with his party''s chairman, Tom Perez,  that candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a socialist, are the future of their party?" "Be bold. Own tax cuts. Talk about jobs." D''Aniello added. "Trump won the presidency with a 38% favorable rating. Today it''s 42%." Practically a landslide in the making...Maybe a "Morning Joe" panelist would join the bandwagon!

(150, 'Absolutely Crabulous: Why Some Crabs Get Dressed Up', 'Covering themselves in everything from algae to urchins, crabs know how to accessorize for safety.', 'Most of us tend to see crabs as just a great set of legs, but they go to all kinds of trouble to be spectacular. The 7,000 species of crabs on earth have looks ranging from scary to cute to surreal. Some are fashionistas, and some make pretty strange fashion choices—like toxic wigs. Charmed and surprised by their ensembles, we couldn’t help wondering, “Why is it that crabs sometimes dress up?” The aptly named sponge crabs of West Africa and the Mediterranean wear sponges on their heads and bodies, not to attract attention but to deflect it. The sponges camouflage the crabs from predators, with some sponge species also emitting toxic or noxious chemicals, making the crab unappealing to predators. Sponge crabs use their back pair of legs “to hold an intact sponge over their body,” says Jay Stachowicz, a marine ecologist at the University of California at Davis. They “often shape the sponge to fit over a large part of their carapace,” or hard exoskeleton. Decorator crabs, on the other hand, “have hooked hairs all over their carapace that act like Velcro to hold any sort of decoration in place,” Stachowicz says. “Some are very picky,” he says. They “protect themselves from predators by using toxic algae or stinging sea anemones,” which, like sponges, can both disguise the crab and deter predators. Others “use materials in proportion to what they find in the environment,” so they simply blend in. Moss crabs of the southwestern U.S. are “the most extreme decorator,” Stachowicz says, carpeting themselves with anemones and bryozoans, tiny moss animals that can look plant-like, furry, or gelatinous. (See more bryozoans in “Mysterious, Brain-Like Blob Found in Lagoon.”) Carrier crabs of the Indo-Pacific and East Africa have specialized back legs that let them hold the weight of a protective sea urchin when they go out for a stroll. Some urchins have venomous spines, but who would want to test if this is one of them? (Watch: Carrier Crab Uses Spiny Urchin as a Shield.) And then there’s the pea-sized pea crab, which doesn’t bother with costumes at all. It just hides inside another animal. Pea crabs live inside bivalves such as mussels and oysters, says Judith Weis, marine biologist at Rutgers University and author of Walking Sideways: The Remarkable World of Crabs. Depending on the species they can be either commensal, a harmless passenger, or parasitic, taking food the mussel could be using and leaving the host a little leaner. (Video: Watch: Crab Tickles Shellfish for Hours to Find Love) A bristled sponge crab in South Australia wears a sponge disguise. Sponge crabs will tailor sponges to get a good fit. Finally, hermit crabs have a tough exoskeleton on their front half and protect their softer back half by finding discarded snail shells to live in. Their soft bodies are coiled to fit in the spiraling shells, though sadly some find less-fitting homes—like humans’ trash. As they grow, Weis says, they need to find larger shells, “just like growing children needing bigger shoes.” Some hermits will even double up by attaching an anemone to their snail shell. If they move to a new shell, they’ll remove their anemones from their old shells and attach them to new ones, Weis says. Anemones benefit from the crab’s mobility, which provides it new feeding spots the otherwise stationary critter wouldn’t have. It might also get some table scraps if its crab host “is a sloppy eater,” says Weis. Pom-pom crabs, also called boxer crabs, have small claws in which they carry small anemones, “enabling the crab to defend itself better and take advantage of the food the anemone captures.” (Related: Watch Pom-Pom Crab Fight With Anemone-Tipped Claws.) And last but not least, the blanket crabs of the Indo-West Pacific are a type of hermit that doesn’t even bother with the shell—they wear just the anemone and can pull it higher or lower over their bodies like a sheet. Sounds like an awfully snug relationship for a hermit.

(151, 'This Suspension Bridge Is Made From Grass', 'The 120-foot-long Incan bridge has been built and rebuilt continuously for five centuries.', 'On either side of a gorge high in the Peruvian Andes, an aging rope bridge sags precariously over the Apurímac River. Every spring, communities gather to take part in a ceremony of renewal. Working together from each side of the river, the villagers run a massive cord of rope, more than a hundred feet long and thick as a person’s thigh, across the old bridge. Soon, the worn structure will be cut loose and tumble into the gorge below. Over three days of work, prayer, and celebration, a new bridge will be woven in its place. The Q’eswachaka bridge has been built and rebuilt continuously for five centuries. For hundreds of years it was the only link between villages on either side of the river in this region of Peru’s Canas Province—just one of many similar rope suspension bridges built during the Inca Empire, linking the massive territory by way of what is now known as the Great Inca Road. The road spanned nearly 25,000 miles and connected previously isolated communities, allowing soldiers, messengers, and ordinary citizens to traverse the empire. The transportation network was part of what the Inca saw as their mandate to “go forth in the world and organize the world after a time of chaos,” says José Barreiro, assistant director of research and director of the Office for Latin America at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. Barreiro was co-curator of an exhibition on the Inca Road and researched the Q’eswachaka Bridge. Although a new metal bridge was built nearby for cars to cross the river, surrounding residents continue using the rope bridge to cross on foot for trade and social visits. “The bridges were part and parcel of that expansion of the empire from Cuzco into four directions, and crossing the very aggressive Andean geography,” he says. The Spanish colonizers who toppled the empire in the 16th century were impressed by the engineering feat of the suspension bridges, built in areas where the rivers were too wide to be connected with wooden beams. But over the years, some of the bridges were destroyed. Others fell into disuse and eventually disappeared with the introduction of new roads and bridges meant to serve cars in the 20th century. Quechua women sit at the top of the canyon and twist ichu grass into rope. During the ceremony, women are not permitted to go down the canyon near the bridge because it is considered bad luck. Largely because of the isolated location, the tradition of the Q’eswachaka bridge endured, and today connects four Quechua-speaking communities: Huinchiri, Chaupibanda, Choccayhua, and Ccollana. Although a new metal bridge was built nearby for cars to cross the river, surrounding residents have continued using the old rope bridge to cross on foot for trade and social visits. The Q’eswachaka bridge was inscribed in 2013 on UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list for its significance to the people still living in the region. “You can see the living culture in front of you today that harks back to 500 years ago,” Barreiro said. “As the political empire of the Incas was destroyed, what was left behind was the culture of the people at the village level.” A major component of that culture is the idea of common labor, he says. Communities join together to work on common projects without the expectation of pay, knowing that the entire village or region will benefit in the end. The newly built Q''eswachaka Bridge hangs over the Apurímac River. The methods of building the bridge, passed down through generations, have changed little over the years. The process begins with the collection of strands of long grass, which are twisted together to form thin ropes. These, in turn, are twisted together into larger ropes, which are finally braided to form the heavy cables that will anchor the bridge. The communities then join together in the task of stretching the cables to prepare them for installation. The cables are affixed to sturdy stone bases and experienced bridge builders begin working their way from the edges to the middle of the bridge, weaving the sides and floor with fibers and sticks. Once the builders meet in the center, they lay matting on the floor, and the new bridge is complete. One notable change in the ritual in recent years is an increase in frequency, Barreiro said. Previously, the communities replaced the bridge once every three years. But as increased accessibility and tourism have brought more visitors to the area, they have increased the frequency to once a year. He attributed this both to safety concerns—the bridge is now seeing more traffic—and to the villagers’ recognition of the opportunity to draw more tourism by making the ceremony an annual ritual. Once the bridge is completed, the communities celebrate with music, prayer, and feasting. The Q’eswachaka Bridge is now ready to serve another year. The Apurímac River cuts through the canyon. During the Inca Empire, suspension bridges connected isolated communities.

(152, 'Will Grizzly Bears Survive Being Hunted?', 'Fierce debate brews over whether Greater Yellowstone bears should be hunted, as a federal judge has postponed hunting seasons in two states.', 'For more than 40 years, it’s been illegal to hunt grizzly bears in the area surrounding Yellowstone National Park, after widespread killing of the creatures left their total regional population severely depleted. But last year, the federal government declared Yellowstone grizzlies as officially recovered and no longer in need of the protections normally afforded to endangered species. That paved the way for hunts to be planned in Wyoming, which set a quota for 22 of the animals, and Idaho, which set its quota at one bear. But on Thursday, two days before the hunting seasons was to start, a federal judge temporarily blocked the states from going forward, for a period of two weeks. During these 14 days U.S. District Judge Dana L. Christensen, in Missoula, Mont., will deliberate over the merits of a suit brought by conservation groups against the Trump administration’s rule to strip grizzlies of endangered species protections. In announced the temporarily block, Christensen has for now sided with the conservation groups, who argue that hunting would cause “irreparable harm” to Yellowstone-area grizzlies. The federal government made its decision after gathering data from animals like Grizzly Bear 927, a 300-pound male grizzly bear who, drawn to a pungent deer leg early one June morning, was sedated by researchers. He woke a few hours later with a lip tattoo, an ear tag, a GPS radio collar. Researchers say information collected from bears like this one hold the key to the species’ future, after nearly half a century on the endangered species list. Whether the solitary carnivores can sustain an annual hunting season is a subject of fierce debate. Set aside the ethical discussion—whether or not people should kill grizzlies for sport—and some wildlife managers say the bears’ population can absorb limited hunting. (Related: "Jane Goodall Joins Wyoming Protestors in Buying Up Grizzly Hunt Tickets.") “Large carnivores are never short of controversy,” says Dan Bjornlie, a large carnivore biologist with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “But hunting, as long as it’s maintained within the mortality thresholds, is not a threat.” Critics disagree. Bear numbers might be greater than they were in the ‘70s, when over-hunting, human expansion and a general effort to eradicate carnivores seen as dangerous to humans and livestock saw the species’ population plummet as low as 136 bears in the wild, but that doesn’t mean they are stable enough to allow for sport hunting, said Bonnie Rice, senior representative of the Sierra Club in the Greater Yellowstone and Northern Rockies Region. “This population is always going to be vulnerable,” Rice said. “It’s the second-slowest reproducing mammal in North America... It’s a species that can’t take that kind of driving down of the population.” Beyond the controversy, most wildlife researchers and conservation groups agree that the Yellowstone grizzly bear’s comeback is a remarkable success story. Officially, more than 700 bears now live in the Greater Yellowstone Area. Researchers say that estimate is low, and as many as 1,000 may actually wander the remote mountains and valleys. The population can support hunting because it has reached its carrying capacity in many portions of core habitat, says Frank van Manen, leader of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, a group of scientists formed by the Department of Interior. And scientific data like that collected from Bear 927 can help effectively manage a hunt by tracking not only the total number of bears, but also factors that affect how many bears could be sustainably removed from the population by hunting, such as the number of reproducing females and survival rates of their young. Each spring and summer, biologists spend several months capturing bears in and around Yellowstone. Almost all of the bears get GPS or VHF collars to track their movements, survival and reproduction. The resulting information, combined with confirmed sightings of females with cubs, are fed into a series of formulas used to estimate annual mortalities and the species’ overall population. “When they came up with ways to estimate it, they wanted to be ultra conservative that there was no way you could overestimate the population,” Bjornlie says. “We’re currently underestimating the population a lot.” So what will protect bears from dropping to the same numbers they did decades ago? Western states can technically hold hunts if the population estimate is above 600, at which point states begin to receive a small percentage of the extra bears. However, there likely wouldn’t be enough extra bears to hunt until the population reached closer to 674, Bjornlie says. This year Wyoming voted to allow 10 male bears and one female bear to be potentially killed in what’s called the “demographic monitoring area,” a relatively undeveloped swath of land considered suitable habitat, and 12 male or female bears outside of it. Idaho decided on one male bear tag, while Montana declined to hold a hunt. Only one hunter can be in the field in Wyoming’s core area at a time. If a female is killed, the hunt ends because it would be difficult for future hunters to tell whether they were aiming at a male or a female. If a hunter in Idaho kills a female, then that female will be subtracted from the next year’s quota, Bjornlie says. If the grizzly population drops further, to below 500, they could be placed back on the endangered species list pending a federal review. Environmentalists like Rice says those contingencies offer little comfort. The Sierra Club is one of several groups suing the federal government to place bears back on the endangered species list. A judge will decide in late August. Rice worries about a lack of genetic diversity—Yellowstone’s grizzlies are disconnected from any other bear populations—and shifting food sources. Climate change may be reducing the annual crop of whitebark pine nuts, a favorite grizzly food source. Researchers from the interagency team say the data shows bears are well equipped to survive those challenges. When whitebark pine cone production drops, for example, bears switch to elk calves or bison, says van Manen. There are enough Yellowstone grizzlies to prevent most inbreeding. And the rising number of fatalities in young bears is largely attributable to the climbing density of adult bears, which are now likely killing cubs. Whether or not a hunter pulls the trigger in September, researchers like Bjornlie will remain in the field trapping bears like 927, keeping tabs on one of the world’s most-studied bear populations.

Venus will sink closer to the sun but grow even brighter, while the brilliant gas giants Jupiter and Saturn will dominate the southern skies. And both hemispheres will be heralding a change of seasons with the arrival of the equinox. So dust off those binoculars, and get set to explore the night this month. Venus and Spica will huddle close together near the horizon on September 1. A half hour after local sunset, look toward the low western sky for a strikingly close pairing of two brilliant points of light, Venus and Spica. The second-closest planet to the sun and the brightest star of the constellation Virgo will appear to be only one degree apart, about equal to the width of two lunar disks. Binoculars will help cut through the glow of sunset and make the pair really pop. The crescent moon will guide you to the brilliant star Aldebaran and the Hyades star cluster on September 3. Just before dawn, look high in the eastern sky for the crescent moon parked next to the red giant star Aldebaran, the lead member of the constellation Taurus. Using binoculars, you should also be able to pick out the distinct V shape of the Hyades star cluster near Aldebaran. With near moonless skies in the predawn hours, the next two weeks mark the best chance for Northern Hemisphere observers to catch the elusive glow of the zodiacal lights. In dark regions far from city lights, look for a pyramid-shaped glow fainter than the Milky Way rising above the eastern horizon before sunrise. This ethereal light is caused by sunlight reflecting off countless dust particles scattered between the planets along the plane of the solar system. As night falls, gaze toward the low southwestern sky for a setting crescent moon to be joined by the brilliant planet Jupiter. Both celestial objects will appear to set below the horizon by 10 p.m. local time. The moon will be near the Teapot asterism, part of the constellation Sagittarius, on September 17. As dusk sets in, the waxing gibbous moon will appear perched above golden-hued Saturn high above the southern sky. Keen-eyed stargazers will also be able to spy the familiar pattern of stars known as the Teapot, part of the constellation Sagittarius, below the shining pair. This year’s September equinox occurs at 9:54 p.m. ET, officially marking the start of fall in the Northern Hemisphere and the start of spring in the south. The word “equinox” comes from the Latin for “equal night” and refers to the even split between the length of day and night that occurs on this particular day of the year. Fall and spring equinoxes are also the only days when the sun rises due east and sets due west. The September equinox marks one of the four major turning points in the cycle of the seasons. The Earth spins on an axis that is tilted 23.5 degrees with respect to its orbital path around the sun. When more of the Northern Hemisphere is tilted closer to the sun, it experiences summer, while the Southern Hemisphere gets winter’s chill, and vice versa. Equinox days mark the transition into spring or fall. Look for the constellation Pegasus rising in the northwest on September 30. Look toward the low northeast sky for the giant constellation Pegasus, the flying horse. The winged steed is the seventh largest constellation in the entire sky, and it’s easy to track down thanks to four brilliant stars that mark out the giant square that forms the body of the beast. From our perspective on Earth’s surface, this boxy piece of celestial real estate is large enough to contain more than 30 full moons side by side. And while each corner star is only moderately bright to the naked eye, they’re relatively easy to locate because there are no stars in this area of sky that are as luminous.

(156, 'Rare White Fawn Born in New York City', 'The birth of a rare white deer on Staten Island—on land meant to be a Native American memorial—is a source of inspiration for the community.', 'A mostly white fawn weaves in and out of the trees, her pearly fleece shimmering, ghostlike. Petite and elegant, she inhabits the historic ramparts and sloping greens of Fort Wadsworth, a 226-acre site on Staten Island’s northeastern shore. The location—one of the oldest American fortifications, first built by the Dutch in the 17th Century—is known for being the starting point of the New York City Marathon each November. Her appearance, according to some, serves as an inspiration to begin anew a different quest: A project to honor Native Americans that dates back more than a century. The young deer can be seen grazing and playing at dawn and dusk with its normal-colored twin and their mother in the glow of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge’s lights, just overhead, on land managed by the National Park Service. Gotham’s greenest borough has been trying to give vasectomies to all the bucks in its growing white-tailed deer population for the past three years in a campaign run by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The program—which costs over $3.3 million—is the first of its kind in the nation, according to the New York Times. In 2016, more than 90 percent of the sexually active male deer on the island were sterilized via vasectomy, a simple surgery that prevents males from passing sperm females. The creature’s coloration is a result of a condition called leucism, which causes a lightening of skin and fur and is found in only one percent of deer. When the white pelt is flecked with the red-brown of normal deer the result is called “piebald.” This coloration is the result of a recessive trait that can also cause skeletal deformities like short or malformed legs, a curved spine, and irregularly-shaped organs, says Doug Adamo, the National Park Service biologist assigned to Fort Wadsworth. Luckily, the fawn appears to be in great shape, all things considered. “Some piebald deer born with mild conditions can live a normal life and survive well into adulthood,” he says; those with severe deformities do not live long and typically do not reach adulthood. The fawn seems resilient in other ways, seemingly unbothered by the cacophony of overhead traffic between Staten Island and Brooklyn. The dozen or so members of her herd are a bit skittish but not entirely uncomfortable around humans that frequent the park. Many Native American tribes consider white animals to carry mystical import, says Margaret Boldeagle, who has Lenape tribe heritage and is a founder of the Red Storm Drum & Dance Troupe on the island. And white deer, especially stags, are mythological stars. King Arthur seeks one that eludes him. Harry Potter summons a silvery white stag to save himself. The Chronicles of Narnia ends when the characters follow a white stag back to their home. And the label of the popular German digestif Jägermeister features a stag with some white fur in an homage to the patron saint of hunters, Saint Hubert, who supposedly converted to Christianity after a mystical encounter with one. The Celts believe it is an emissary from the afterlife, and cultures from Hungary to Scotland to Japan have stories as well. Killing a white deer is illegal in several states, and where it is not illegal there is a folk tradition that it’s very unlucky to do so. There is a sanctuary for them in Seneca County, New York, where more than 70 of the animals run free. “You have a beauty,” says sanctuary director Dennis Money, of the Staten Island fawn. Much more than a genetic anomaly, some Native Americans see the rare animal as an inspiration for renewed work on what is to them sacred ground. Here, Congress had granted land for building the North American Indian Memorial, which was to include a museum and a statue taller than Lady Liberty. In February 1913, President William Howard Taft and 32 chiefs from around the nation went so far as to gather at this spot and broke ground using stone axe found near the site, a moment that lives on film in the National Archives. Even Cheyenne leader Two Moons and Red Hawk of the Sioux, who both battled General George Armstrong Custer at the Little Bighorn, were present. Boldeagle was stunned to see the animal; for her it’s a “sign from the Creator” to continue her mission. “I have been working very hard to revive the memorial and was about to give up until the arrival of the white fawn,” she says. She named the fawn Naim (after the memorial’s acronym) and held a benefit concert for the effort August 25. Thomas De Lacy, a Native American from Honduras, and a New York City police detective, plans to perform an Eagle Dance for the fawn at Fort Wadsworth during the September Equinox. These rituals honor eagles, which are believed to carry the prayers of the earthbound to heaven, and follow in the tradition of De Lacy’s tribe, a branch of the Mayans known as the Lenca. “The white fawn is a birth, but it is really a rebirth,” De Lacy says. “The time is now for us all to come together and complete this memorial.” The memorial, which was being financed by Philadelphia department store scion Rodman Wanamaker, fell apart after the outbreak of World War I. That war was ignited by the assassination of Austria’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. According to Smithsonian magazine, legend tells that the archduke—an avid hunter—said he felt bad luck would befall him and that he would die young because he had killed a white stag the year before his murder. Staten Island artist Johnny Lohse, who descends from the Iroquois, says the white fawn is a reminder that a promise was made in 1913 which must be respected. “And the National American Indian Memorial should be a source of pride for not only Native Americans, but all Americans and people worldwide.” The memorial could serve as a cultural jewel for Staten Island’s north shore, which is booming with nearly $2 billion in private and public investment. Margaret Boldeagle says that the Native American stone axe that President Taft and the 32 chiefs used in 1913 is still in safekeeping somewhere in the borough. “I hope to use it to break ground again,” she says.

(157, 'How U.S. Clipper Ships Changed World Trade', 'Clipper ships traveled at blistering speeds but conditions on board were brutal, and opium was their most profitable cargo.', 'In their day, they were the fastest ships ever to have been built. They revolutionized global trade, ferrying tea from China and delivering provisions and equipment to the burgeoning settlement of Gold Rush-era San Francisco. Their owners would become some of the richest men in the United States. But as historian Steven Ujifusa shows in his new book, Barons of the Sea, clipper ships also had a dark side: They serviced the opium trade, which left millions of Chinese addicted, and employed brutal, and sometimes dangerous, methods to make their ships sail faster. When National Geographic caught up with Ujifusa in Washington, D.C., he explained how clipper ship owners reconciled their religious backgrounds with the opium trade, how steamships and the railroad eventually rendered clipper ships obsolete, and how a clipper ship with a female navigator held the record for the fastest voyage from New York to San Francisco right up to the 1980s. A historian said of the clipper ships: “Illicit and desperate practices followed close in their wake throughout their existence.” Explain what he meant, and what the Americans’ goal was in producing them. So-called Baltimore clippers, which were built in the Maryland Chesapeake Bay area in the 1810s and 1820s, were used as slave smugglers and privateers. By the 1840s, American merchants doing business in China took these designs and expanded them into China clippers, carrying tea from Canton to New York and, later, Hong Kong. These merchants also used variants of the Baltimore clippers as opium runners, smuggling opium into China, thanks to bribes given to Chinese officials who were there to stop the opium trade but, instead, facilitated it. What’s distinctive about a clipper ship as opposed to other types of vessels? The definition of an American clipper ship is a three-masted, full-rigged ship with square sails on each of her three masts that was built for speed rather than capacity. So the designers of the great clipper ships of the 1840s and 1850s sharpened the bow and stern, creating much hollower lines than before. They were built to carry high-value freight, like tea from China or, during the Gold Rush, dry goods and provisions to California that would fetch very high prices. These ships were also much more loftily rigged than typical merchant ships. This made them very expensive to operate because you needed crews of 50 or 60 men. Shipping barons like Warren Delano and Robert Forbes got rich from the opium trade in China, which left millions addicted or dead. Introduce us to these men and explain how they squared their Protestant morality with what was essentially drug running, and how it eventually led to the Opium War. Several of the men I feature come from a tight-knit group of Yankee families in the Boston and New Bedford area. They didn’t see anything wrong with the opium trade. Robert Bennett Forbes compared the opium trade to nothing worse than dealing in liquor or strong spirits, and Warren Delano wrote that the opium trade was a perfectly honorable, legitimate trade. But when they were living in the foreigners’ colony in Canton in the 1830s, they didn’t actually see its effects on the Chinese population all that much. In 1838, a new governor of Canton Province was tasked by the emperor with showing the foreign devils, as western traders were known, who was boss. This new commissioner demands that the Americans and British hand over 20,000 chests of opium to the Chinese government for destruction. The British and Americans say, “This is our opium; how can you do this?” So the commissioner promptly blockades the Foreigners Colony, in Canton, and the opium is thrown into the Pearl River. The British traders leave, saying, “We’ll be back with force because you just confiscated the Queen’s opium.” On their return, they shell Canton in revenge and Canton is burned. Under the terms of the Treaty of Nanking, the Chinese government is forced pay 21 million pounds sterling as reparations, not just for the seizure of the British opium but also for the costs for the British Royal Navy to sail over there. The treaty also forces open several other ports for Western trade, which allows opium to flow unchecked into the Celestial Kingdom, thus beginning the so-called “Century of Humiliation” for the Chinese. You call the clipper ship builder Donald McKay a “mechanic and craftsman as American hero.” Tell us about him and the “extreme clippers” he built in Boston. He was an immigrant success story. He was born in 1810 in Nova Scotia, the son of an itinerant shipwright and farmer, came to New York, then opened up his own yard in East Boston in the 1840s, becoming a kind of Jacksonian, common-man hero. He once said something to the effect of, “My words and language are rough but my feelings are honest and true.” He began building a series of very successful, very large ships for the California trade. There’s an old naval design rule that the longer the waterline length of a vessel, the faster it can go. So McKay built clippers that were significantly larger than the old China clippers. McKay’s clippers to California grew to almost 300 feet long and The Republic was almost 400 feet long. This represented a tremendous growth in terms of how big these ships got and how fast they went. Clipper ships like these helped build San Francisco into the city we know today. Starting in 1848-1849, there was a huge demand for miner’s supplies —furniture, chairs, tables, provisions, and lots of booze—to be shipped around Cape Horn from the East Coast, to the new city of San Francisco, which grew from a fishing village of 2,000 people to a major metropolis of over 100,000 by the mid-to-late 1850s. This was similar to how Jeff Bezos revolutionized the supply chain for goods from all over the world. The China clippers would bring tea from Canton or Hong Kong to New York, cutting down the typical sailing speed from 160 days to under 100 days. This was truly revolutionary. One of McKay’s clippers reportedly logged 22 knots, a speed that steamships would not reach until the 1890s. Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman is about a ship’s captain who makes a deal with Satan in exchange for speed. The clipper ships had their own version of the legend in “driver captains” like Robert Waterman. Tell us about him and his fatal voyage in Challenge. Robert Waterman had a long history of making record passages from China. While onshore, he was a dandy and a ladies man, but on ships he was an absolute tyrant. In 1851, he was given command of a clipper ship called The Challenge. She was 2,000 tons and had masts well over 200 feet high. His bosses, the Griswold brothers, offered him a $10,000 bonus if he made it to San Francisco in less than 90 days. But Waterman was given the dregs of the waterfront as a crew. Ultimately, there is a near-mutiny, several men are beaten to death or fall from the yard, and the ship sails into San Francisco Harbor after a voyage of 109 days, flying a distress flag. Waterman is tried for murder in San Francisco. This is one of the more violent episodes in the clipper ship era and exposes to the nation and to the world how men and safety were sacrificed for the quickest possible passage to get goods to market first. This was an era before any sort of regulation of conditions on board or of labor. The way crews were recruited was a bit like the Royal Navy with its press gangs. Actually, that’s where the term Shanghaied came from. Captains would often have a hard time getting enough men to crew up these clipper ships, which needed 50 to 60 men to sail efficiently. So, they would send out so-called “crimps” to the brothels and bars of lower Manhattan or Boston and, working in cahoots with the madams and saloonkeepers, drop drugs into the drinks of the patrons, who would then wake up with a splitting headache, a third of their wages gone and on the way to China or San Francisco. [laughs] I was amazed to read that the Flying Cloud’s record of 89 days and 21 hours from New York to San Francisco stood until 1989. Tell us about the various attempts on that record, and what it says about the clipper ships. The Flying Cloud was unique. Not only was she an exceptionally well-built clipper, and arguably McKay’s masterpiece before The Great Republic, but she also had a very good team. She had a very good captain, Captain Josiah Creesy. He had been in the China trade before. He also had a very valuable asset: his wife, Eleanor Creesy, who served as his navigator. She used a new set of charts that allowed the navigator to find the optimal winds and currents to make a quick passage by avoiding the doldrums. Without her, the Flying Cloud would not have made that voyage. And it was not until the late 1980s that the sailing yacht Thursday’s Child broke the record. Some people say that it doesn’t really count because she was a yacht, not a commercial vessel, and that the record under sail still stands. Eventually, clipper ships became what you call “beautiful anachronisms.” Talk about their legacy for the United States, and the sea barons who built them. The end of the clipper ships came about due to the railroads, first across the Panama Isthmus and later across the continental U.S., which made such long-haul voyages by sail less profitable. Also, the rise of long-distance steam ships and the trans-Atlantic cable, which allowed information, especially financial information, to be transmitted almost instantaneously. The Civil War also wreaked havoc on the clipper ship era, when Confederate raiders chased down and sank several clippers. As for the legacy of these ships, even though their era was extremely brief, they still persist in the American imagination. Naval historian Samuel Eliot Morisonsaid that these clipper ships came and went with the finality of the passenger pigeon, but these were our cathedrals of wood, our Parthenons, the most complex structures we had ever built. And they still elicit wonder today. They were built for brutal, laissez faire capitalism, but in terms of their angelic beauty they are peerless. Warren Delano II was one of the most famous of the men who derived their fortunes from owning clipper ships. He and several of his business partners would diversify their China trade fortunes into industries such as the railroads, coal and copper mining, the Trans-Atlantic cable, and real estate. When Warren Delano died in 1898 he bequeathed well over $1 million to each of his children, which would put him on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy men in America at the time. His most famous descendant was his grandson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who, as a successful politician, loved to quote his grandfather’s famous dictum: “In business, never let your right hand know what your left hand is doing.” Many of the great clipper ship fortunes funded famous preparatory schools, like Milton Academy, and universities such as Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, as well as many other well-known cultural institutions. It’s a contradiction that these men were engaged in the opium trade but, when they came home, used their fortunes to invest in early American industries and civic institutions that we still know, and venerate, to this day.

(158, 'Fire Devastates Brazil''s Oldest Science Museum', 'The overnight inferno likely claimed fossils, cultural artifacts, and more irreplaceable collections amassed over 200 years.', 'Major pieces of Brazil''s scientific and cultural heritage went up in smoke on Sunday night, as a devastating fire ripped through much of Rio de Janeiro''s Museu Nacional, or National Museum. Founded in 1818, the museum is Brazil''s oldest scientific institution and one of the largest and most renowned museums in Latin America, amassing a collection of some 20 million scientifically and culturally invaluable artifacts. The Museu Nacional''s holdings include Luzia, an 11,500-year-old skull considered one of South America''s oldest human fossils, as well as the bones of uniquely Brazilian creatures such as the long-necked dinosaur Maxakalisaurus. Because of the auction tastes of Brazil''s 19th-century emperors, the Museu Nacional also ended up with Latin America''s oldest collection of Egyptian mummies and artifacts. Even the building holds historical importance: It housed the exiled Portuguese royal family from 1808 to 1821, after they fled to Rio de Janeiro in 1807 to escape Napoleon. The complex also served as the palace for Brazil''s post-independence emperors until 1889, before the museum collections were transferred there in 1902. In a Monday interview, Federal University of Espírito Santo paleontologist Taissa Rodrigues said that some of the metal cabinets containing fossils may have withstood the fire, though it''s unclear whether the fossils inside survived. Duane Fonseca, a biologist at Brazil''s Federal University of Rio Grande, reported on Twitter on Monday that technicians had saved some of the museum''s more than 40,000 mollusk specimens. But now, many of the fossils, the Egyptian collection, the museum''s invertebrate specimens, and more artifacts housed in the main building are probably destroyed. The museum''s fish and reptile specimens, herbarium, and library were housed separately and are thought to have survived. “When I saw the news about the tragedy, I just started crying, and all my colleagues, other archaeologists I know in Brazil, they had the same reaction—that’s a loss for all the world,” says Maria Ester Franklin Maia Silva, a Brazilian archaeologist and Ph.D. student at the University of São Paulo. It''s not yet clear how the fire started, but it did begin after the museum was closed to the public, and no injuries have yet been reported. Firefighters worked through the night to douse the burnt-out shell of the main building, but it seems the blaze has already seared a gaping hole in many scientists'' careers. “The importance of the collections that were lost couldn''t be overstated,” says Luiz Rocha, a Brazilian ichthyologist now at the California Academy of Sciences who has visited the Museu Nacional several times to study its collections. “They were unique as it gets: Many of them were irreplaceable, there''s no way to put a monetary value on it.” “In terms of [my] life-long research agenda, I''m pretty much lost,” says Marcus Guidoti, a Brazilian entomologist finishing up his Ph.D. in a program co-run by Brazil''s Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. Guidoti studies lace bugs, an insect family with more than 2,000 species worldwide. The Museu Nacional held one of the world''s largest lace bug collections, but the fire likely destroyed it and the rest of the museum''s five million arthropod specimens. “Those type specimens can''t be replaced, and they are crucial to understand the species,” he says by text message. “If I was willing to keep working on this family in this region of the globe, this was definitely a big hit.” Paleontologist Dimila Mothé, a postdoctoral researcher at the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, adds that the blows to science extend beyond the collections themselves. “It''s not only the cultural history, the natural history, but all the theses and research developed there,” she says. “Most of the laboratories there were lost, too, and the research of several professors. I''m not sure you can say the impact of what was lost.” Brazil’s indigenous knowledge also has suffered. The Museu Nacional housed world-renowned collections of indigenous objects, as well as many audio recordings of indigenous languages from all over Brazil. Some of these recordings, now lost, were of languages that are no longer spoken. “I have no words to say how horrible this is,” says Brazilian anthropologist Mariana Françozo, an expert on South American indigenous objects at Leiden University. “The indigenous collections are a tremendous loss…we can no longer study them, we can no longer understand what our ancestors did. It’s heartbreaking.” On Monday, The Brazilian publication G1 Rio reported that ashes of burned documents—some still flecked in notes or illustrations—have rained down from the sky more than a mile away from the Museu Nacional, thrown aloft by the inferno. This is not the first time in recent years that the world lost a natural history museum. In April 2016, India''s National Museum of Natural History in New Delhi was also destroyed in a fire. Nor is this the first time that fire has claimed an invaluable part of Brazil''s heritage. In 2010, blazes ripped through the Instituto Butantan, a major biomedical research laboratory in São Paulo, destroying one of the world''s largest collections of venomous animal specimens. The fire vaporized more than half a million preserved snakes, spiders, and scorpions collected over a hundred years. “This is far from being a problem unique to Brazil," says the paleontologist Rodrigues. “Collections worldwide are at risk, and unless we take good care of them, these kinds of things will happen again and again and again.” In a statement posted on Twitter, Brazilian president Michael Temer lamented the Museu Nacional''s loss as “incalculable to Brazil” and “a sad day for all Brazilians.” But the Brazilian government is facing mounting criticism over complaints that the tragedy was preventable. Since 2014, the Museu Nacional hasn''t received its full annual $128,000 budget; this year, it received a paltry $13,000. In 2015, the Museu Nacional was forced to close its doors temporarily because it could no longer pay its cleaning and security staff. The museum''s curators had to crowdfund repairs to termite damage in one of the most popular exhibit halls, which contained the skeleton of a humpback whale and bones from the dinosaur Maxakalisaurus. A full-size replica of the dinosaur Maxakalisaurus topai is seen on display at the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2006. In May 2018—on the eve of its 200th anniversary—ten of the museum''s 30 exhibits were closed to the public because of disrepair. At the time, the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported that the museum had peeling walls and exposed electrical wiring. The two fire hydrants near the musem were reportedly empty, forcing firefighters to use water trucks and pond water from Quinta da Boa Vista, the urban park containing the Museu Nacional. “In my point of view, Brazil had responsibility to keep these artifacts safe, [and] Brazil failed on that,” says Franklin Maia Silva. Already, the Brazilian government has pledged that it will start studying how to rebuild the Museu Nacional. Folha de S.Paulo also reports that culture minister Sérgio Sá Leitão has called for inspections of other Brazilian museums'' fire protection systems. But researchers point out that simply fixing the building will do little to fill the gaping hole in Brazilian science, especially as the country continues to slash research budgets. In March 2017, Temer cut science funding by 44 percent, to $1 billion—the lowest levels since 2005—and in late 2017, he proposed further cuts of another 16 percent. Some of the country''s research institutions have struggled to pay for basic amenities such as electricity bills, reports Nature. “Science in general in Brazil is seen as something we don''t need to invest in,” says Rocha. “I hope [Brazilian leaders] open their eyes and see that it''s worth investing in, besides rebuilding.” “First, there’s disbelief that they will really fund the reincorporation of the museum, and [my] second reaction is anger, because they knew the museum needed funding for years,” Françozo adds. “How do you ‘rebuild’ a 200-year-old collection that has burned to ashes?” In the meantime, local students are working on a rebuilding project of their own: “In the face of tonight''s tragedy, the students of the museology course at UNIRIO [the Federal University for the State of Rio de Janeiro] are mobilizing to preserve the memory of the National Museum,” the Museu Nacional said in an email. “We ask everyone who possesses images (photographs/videos/even selfies) of the collection and exhibition spaces to share them with us.” The students may well get a submission from Emilio Bruna, an ecologist at the University of Florida. Bruna''s work often takes him to Brazil, where he studies habitat fragmentation. But when he recently visited the Museu Nacional with his wife—a native Brazilian—and their children, the family strolled the halls as tourists. “You walk through this building that was there at the origins of this incredibly rich and vibrant country, you saw people proud to see the fossils of Brazilian dinosaurs—of animals unique to their country. As soon as I found out [about the fire] and blurted it out, my son was in tears. He was just devastated,” Bruna says. “Museums are living, breathing repositories of who we are and where we’ve come from, and the world around us,” he adds. “Those insects pinned in a drawer, or those fish in a jar, or a feathered cape you might see in a display case—that represents a little piece of who we are as a people, as humans, as part of a greater world. “And when those specimens are lost, we lose some of who we are.” ', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/09/news-museu-nacional-fire-rio-de-janeiro-natural-history.html', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/science/2018/09/05/brazil-museum-fire/rio-national-museum-fire.jpg', '2018-09-04 12:30:28', 213, 3),
(159, 'How South Asian Americans Are Building a New American Dream', 'They''re expanding on the success of their immigrant parents, creating a blended cultural identity—and turning the tables on old stereotypes.', 'The stand-up comic Hari Kondabolu, who is Indian American, had just finished telling a joke about being brown in America when the laughter was interrupted. “Thank you, come again!” a heckler yelled mockingly in a thick, faux Indian accent. The phrase is instantly recognizable to millions of fans of The Simpsons television show as the signature utterance of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, who is portrayed unabashedly as a racial stereotype: the thrifty, borderline unscrupulous, and somewhat servile Indian convenience store owner. To Kondabolu, those words at a show in October 2015 were even more familiar. Like many people of South Asian heritage in the United States, Kondabolu had “Thank you, come again!” aimed at him countless times while growing up. Now his irritation found expression in a smiling comeback. “I know you from high school, even though I don’t,” he said, pointing at the heckler. “You are the reason I do comedy, sir.” Kondabolu, 35, has a boyish appearance, with a mop of wavy, dark hair on top of a chubby face that seems to bear a perpetual expression of mild amusement. His friendliness belies the scathing quality of his humor. “Knowing that the accent was used to mock us made me very apprehensive to have people meet my family,” Kondabolu told me about his adolescent years, when I met him and his immigrant parents, Ravi and Uma, in Queens, New York. His response was to find a comedic voice of his own to skewer the often cartoonish, one-dimensional portrayal of brown people in American media and popular culture. One of his early jokes was a riff on a caption he says he read on a picture of the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which is part of the British crown jewels, describing the precious stone as having been found in India in the mid-1800s. “Right. It was just found in India. It wasn’t taken from India. It was just found there,” he says, because Indians didn’t know what diamonds were and were “grinding them up, putting them into curry,” and making “diamond biryani” until “luckily the British showed up.” Another joke was about how his mother would pretend to call adoption services whenever he and his brother were being troublesome. “One day we discovered there was nobody on the other end of the phone, and so the next time she said it, I told her I would be calling immigration, and that ended that.” It was satisfying to Kondabolu that he could reference the same racial tropes that irked him to challenge stereotypes. “When you get to a place where you are telling your own stories, that’s huge,” he said. “That’s control.” Kondabolu brought his journey as a satirist full circle with his documentary film, The Problem With Apu, which opens with a clip of his response to the heckler. The film argues that the character is racist. Kondabolu finds it ridiculous that one of the most visible representations of Indian Americans on TV is a caricature voiced by “a white guy doing an impression of a white guy making fun of my father.” (The Simpsons appears on Fox TV, which is owned by 21st Century Fox, the majority owner of National Geographic Partners.) Kondabolu is one of many second-generation South Asian Americans, predominantly of Indian heritage, who have gained prominence in mainstream American comedy in the past few years. Their success represents a significant milestone in the integration of people of South Asian descent into American society. By mining their immigrant experience for laughs, Kondabolu and others are giving expression to a self-assurance that many first-generation immigrants did not have. The increased visibility of South Asian Americans in popular culture mirrors the rise of this relatively new immigrant group in various walks of American life—in science, medicine, technology, business—and now increasingly in politics and public service, as exemplified by Ravi S. Bhalla, the new mayor of the largely white city of Hoboken, New Jersey, who, like many Sikh men, wears a turban. In recent years South Asians have been one of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the United States, increasing in population from 2.2 million in 2000 to 4.9 million in 2015. About 80 percent of the demographic is Indian, with a median annual household income of $100,000—nearly double the median for all U.S. households. Even though some communities with roots in South Asian countries, like Bangladeshis and Nepalis, are generally far less affluent, the overall success of South Asian Americans is no mystery. It can be partly explained by U.S. policy, which since the 1960s has selectively encouraged educated foreign workers and high-performing students to immigrate. Owing to its large English-speaking population, a result of British colonialism, and the quality of some of its educational institutions, India became a major source of such talent. And family-based immigration opened the doors to a broad array of South Asians. Second-generation South Asians are building on that success, with many such as Kondabolu venturing outside career paths typically favored by their immigrant parents. As they find their place in the nation’s ever changing tapestry, they are forming a cultural identity that blends values and traditions they inherited into a new way of being American. “When you are the child of an immigrant and you are running for office, or you are a journalist telling a story, or you are an actor-performer who has a platform to speak, this is all new, but it’s examples of us saying, ‘Hey, we are valid,’” Kondabolu told me. “‘Hey, see our stories? They aren’t stories of foreigners. They are the stories of people here in America.’” When I set out to write this piece, I had more than a journalistic interest in second-generation South Asians. I am an Indian immigrant, having arrived in 1999 to go to graduate school, where I met my future wife, who grew up in the U.S. I still hum Bollywood songs and habitually surf Indian news sites, but I have a deep sense of belonging to America. Our two children were born here, and last year I became a U.S. citizen. Learning about the lives of second-generation South Asians, I hoped, would help me imagine my children’s future. Many second-generation South Asians were born to highly educated immigrant parents and have had a privileged upbringing, like that of Subash Bazaz, a 47-year-old cardiologist. On a recent Sunday morning, I went to Great Falls, Virginia, to meet his family. I took off my shoes at the door, as is customary in many Indian homes, and was greeted by three generations: Bazaz; his parents, Bansi and Veena, who immigrated from India in 1970; and his 16-year-old son, Abhishek. Bansi Bazaz, an 80-year-old retired doctor of internal medicine with large eyes and a slight frame, was visiting for a weekly ritual: driving with his grandson to his class in tabla, a pair of traditional drums played by hand. The contrast between the lives of grandfather, son, and grandson offers a glimpse into how being South Asian in America has evolved since the first big wave of immigrants began arriving in the 1960s, when long-standing barriers to immigration from Asia were removed. Bansi was part of that wave—one of many South Asian doctors who immigrated. “It was a gold rush,” said Bansi, who grew up in Kashmir and studied medicine in Bangalore. He took a job in Ogdensburg, New York, a town with fewer than 15,000 residents then. “What the white doctors didn’t want to do—those were the only jobs that were open.” It was there that his son, Subash Bazaz, a mild-mannered man with a soothing voice, grew up. “There was a very small Indian community, mostly made up of other doctors like my dad,” he recalled. The families mainly socialized with each other. His parents, like many immigrant parents, wanted him to stay focused on academics. “We couldn’t go out all the time, couldn’t have sleepovers. Dating was really frowned upon,” Bazaz said. “The Indian background did put barriers between myself and my white peers.” At school he did his best to avoid drawing attention to his Indian heritage, never bringing lunch from home because the spicy aroma would have made him stand out. Although Bazaz went through a phase of trying to shed his Indian identity—“I didn’t want to be seen clinging to other Indian folks”—by the time he finished college, his closest friends were Indian Americans. This arc of shunning and then embracing one’s heritage is a familiar theme in the lives of many second-generation immigrants. As an immigrant doctor, Bazaz’s father told me, he had to fight for fair treatment and equal opportunity. By contrast, Bazaz says he faced no perceptible barriers. When he entered the profession, doctors of Indian ancestry were more the norm than a novelty. He had the option of pursuing opportunities in cities big and small and joined a practice in the Washington, D.C., area with three Indian-American cardiologists. After Abhishek consumed the omelet made by his mother, Sameera, who is of Indian descent, I went with him to the house of his tabla instructor. “Playing the tabla is one way for me to appreciate Indian culture,” said Abhishek, who rarely listens to Indian music. He and his grandfather both commented on how different it is growing up Indian American now because of the large South Asian population in some cities. That was in evidence at the instructor’s house, where one batch of students—all of Indian heritage—was leaving as Abhishek, a broad-shouldered boy with a shy smile, sat down cross-legged with seven other boys. As he tapped fast and furiously on his tabla, Abhishek’s fingers became a blur. Some second-generation South Asians grew up in less fortunate circumstances than Bazaz and Kondabolu. They were raised by parents who slaved away in physically demanding blue-collar jobs that more often than not were low paying. Notably many Indians from the state of Gujarat bought and ran budget motels. South Asians without money or advanced education washed dishes, stocked shelves at grocery stories, and drove taxis, which is what Tanzina Ahmed’s father did. (Click here to read about how Indian Americans came to own half of U.S. motels.) When Ahmed came to New York City from Bangladesh in 1990 as a five-year-old, she barely spoke English. The language barrier made it difficult to make friends at school. Despite her struggles or perhaps because of them, Ahmed excelled in school. She got impressive results on the SAT, including a perfect score in the verbal section. Ahmed’s family, however, had arrived as undocumented immigrants, and she discovered this made her ineligible for most scholarships and financial-aid programs. “It was like having a window you think is open for you just a crack slammed on your face,” she said. Ahmed, who has sparkling eyes and a sardonic wit, subsequently discovered a rare scholarship program—at the City University of New York—that wasn’t closed to undocumented students. She received a full merit scholarship to CUNY’s Macaulay Honors College. Her parents were eager to see her on a path to citizenship. The only solution they could think of was to arrange a marriage to a U.S. citizen, and so, while Ahmed was pursuing a doctorate in psychology, she married a Bangladeshi-American man found by her parents. Their marriage ran into trouble but lasted long enough for her to get citizenship. The Indian population’s average annual earnings of $75,000 exceed the U.S. average of $46,000, largely due to high-paying science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers. Fewer than 8 percent of Indians in America live below the poverty line, compared with 13.5 percent of the U.S. population. Only 17 percent of Indians age 25 or over don’t have a degree beyond a high school diploma or GED certificate, compared with 41 percent of the U.S. population in the same age group. Forty percent of Indians age 25 or over have degrees higher than a bachelor’s, compared with 11 percent for the U.S. population age 25 or over. Indian-born college grads in the U.S. have degrees or jobs in STEM or the social sciences. Half of all U.S.-born college grads have degrees or jobs in these fields. This is the only category shown where the figure for Indians in America nearly matches the national average. Ahmed, who has taught at Bronx Community College, is now remarried—to a Malaysian-Chinese American she met through mutual friends. Over the past few years, she said, “I have grown so much more comfortable with my identity as a Bengali-American, Muslim woman.” For much of her life, she says, she resented her Bengali roots—first because of bullying and harassment at school and later when her parents found her a match. After her divorce the resentment began fading away. “I realized that there are parts of my identity and this cultural background that I’m really proud of,” she said. “I like the fact that we come together as a family, and we choose to live near each other and help each other out a lot. I like the fact that we don’t endorse things like going on Tinder and dating five million people.” A defining characteristic of many South Asians—and Asians generally—is a keen aspiration for career success. The pressure to do well at school is a common theme, reflected in the prevalence of South Asian kids participating in—and winning—spelling bees and competitions in science and math. Their parents are more inclined to nudge them toward professions such as medicine and law, but increasingly second-generation South Asians are following their hearts. Kondabolu, too, felt that pressure to walk a familiar path. When he was trying out comedy in school and in college, his parents hoped it was just a phase. “They said, ‘Don’t let it interfere with your studies,’ which it did,” he said. After college Kondabolu wanted to pursue stand-up, but his mother wanted him to go to graduate school. At the time he felt angry. “I remember thinking, All these white kids get support—‘Yeah, be what you want to be’—and I couldn’t get that support.” Kondabolu moved to Seattle to work as an activist for immigrant rights and did stand-up in the evenings. He got noticed. After appearing at an HBO comedy festival and on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, he felt ready to dive headlong into comedy. But when he was accepted at the London School of Economics to do a master’s in human rights, his mother, a tall, poised woman who trained as a doctor, wanted him to go. “I had a career that had just started,” he said. “And my mom said, ‘You’ve got to do the master’s.’” Kondabolu got the degree but began doing comedy full-time after returning to New York City. “In six months I wanted to quit,” he told me. “I was like, What am I doing? I have a master’s degree. My classmates are working at the UN, the World Bank, UNICEF, and I am telling jokes in the basement of a bar that takes me two hours to get to and two hours to get back?” But his parents, reassured he had a fallback, encouraged him. Kondabolu kept at it, and success followed. The material that he and fellow South Asian comics present has found a diverse and growing audience over the past decade. “Because our stories were suppressed for so long, everything is new and exciting and interesting,” Kondabolu said. In the early years he used a thick Indian accent in some of his comedy—like the bit about his mother calling adoption services—but later dropped it, feeling that it detracted from his desire to tell jokes from “a place of empowerment and not of self-deprecation.” With his documentary Kondabolu has arguably started one of the most important public discussions about South Asians in America. After airing on cable in November, The Problem With Apu sparked a debate between those who agree with his criticisms and others who feel he’s being overly sensitive. His parents, Uma and Ravi, were never bothered by Apu in the way that Kondabolu was, a divergence attributable perhaps to how differently the generations view their place in American society. “When we came, we knew we were entering a foreign place,” Uma told me. “This country doesn’t owe us anything.” Kondabolu, on the other hand, took for granted that he was entitled to a voice in America. “I believe that this isn’t about me turning into you,” he said. “This is about us sharing and coming up with something different. That’s what America is—it’s about changing with every new idea and person that comes here.” For some South Asians, parental expectations go beyond achieving high levels of professional success. They also can come under pressure to conform to cultural traditions. That can mean running into opposition within the family when deciding to marry outside one’s religion, caste, or race—an experience that Ambar Zobairi faced. A 44-year-old Pakistani-American woman who grew up in Carbondale, Illinois, Zobairi works at the International Foundation for Electoral Systems in Washington, D.C. She has spent more than a decade helping to increase public participation in elections and governance throughout the Middle East and North Africa. In countries such as Lebanon and Libya, Zobairi, who has deep-set eyes that convey warmth, has focused on empowering women. Twenty-five years ago Zobairi had to fight her own battle to be with the man she loved. In 1993, three months after she had begun dating a white American college classmate named Mark Henderson, her father, Riazuddin, then a professor of religious history at Southern Illinois University, gave her an audiocassette. As she listened to it in her room, tears streamed down her face. “He said how much he loved me and that he knew that I must be in love. He expressed that he always wanted me to be happy but that he really wished for me to be with somebody who was Muslim,” Zobairi recalled. She said her father also worried he would lose his standing in Carbondale’s conservative Pakistani community. Despite her emotional turmoil, Zobairi was steadfast. She had strong, independent-minded women in her family to take inspiration from, most notably her mother, a Pakistani Christian, who had married Zobairi’s father over the objections of her family. “I always knew that if there was a path I needed to take, even if it was going to be difficult, I was going to continue on that path,” she said. Zobairi stopped meeting with Henderson in public, but they kept the relationship going through phone calls and letters. Her life at home went on as usual, although tensions remained in the background. Henderson—worried about the possible estrangement between Zobairi and her father—eventually told her father he would embrace Islam. Reciting a one-sentence testimony of faith at the Islamic Center of Carbondale, he became a Muslim. In the summer of 1997, Zobairi and Henderson married. During the weekday rush hour, while riding a train in the San Francisco Bay Area, I found myself in a sea of brown faces. It was a reminder of the immense presence of people of South Asian origin—more specifically, of Indian origin—working in Silicon Valley, many of whom entered the country under the H-1B visa program to fill a shortage of technology workers. Not only do Indian immigrants and second-generation Indian Americans constitute a significant slice of the U.S. tech workforce, but they also lead major companies such as Google and Microsoft. For a close-up of life inside this prosperous enclave, I visited Nirav Tolia, the 46-year-old co-founder of Nextdoor, a social-networking service for neighborhoods that recently was valued at more than one billion dollars. Tolia is trim, with a youthful face that has no hint of facial hair. The son of Indian immigrants who are both doctors, he grew up on a cul-de-sac in a predominantly white neighborhood in Odessa, Texas, where neighbors would give him rides to school, babysit him, and watch him when his parents were traveling. They invited him to swim in their pools and play tennis on their courts. “We’d come back from visiting relatives in India, and I’d literally want to kiss the ground,” Tolia told me. The memory of that warm and nurturing community is what inspired Tolia—along with six partners, including another Indian American—to found Nextdoor. Launched seven years ago, it enables users to connect with neighbors and share information useful to the community, from car break-ins to used-toy giveaways. Tolia describes it as an online tool for strengthening bonds between neighbors—bonds that have frayed all over the world. Tolia started out at Yahoo!, where many of his colleagues, including his boss, were of Indian ancestry. He was also being mentored and supported by the Indus Entrepreneurs, a South Asian networking nonprofit with thousands of members in more than a dozen countries, which helped him when he co-founded his first start-up, Epinions, a consumer review site. “Not only is my race and identity not holding me back, but I’m in a place where some of the most successful people in the industry are my race,” he said. After Epinions merged with another company and went public, Tolia made a fortune, but not without controversy. He resigned from the new company in 2004 after it was discovered that he had misrepresented his degree and experience on his résumé. He was also sued by some of his former partners, who had made nothing on the deal, resulting in an undisclosed settlement. On a recent afternoon Tolia and his wife, Megha, an Indian American who went to Harvard Business School and is now a vice president at Method, which makes environmentally friendly cleaning products, gave me a tour of their home—an elegant, 8,000-square-foot, five-level modern mansion. While showing me the master bedroom, which opens out to a large terrace with a breathtaking view of San Francisco Bay, Tolia heard the second of their three sons, four-year-old Dylan, stirring awake from his nap. Dylan was still under the covers, yawning, when we entered his room. Tolia had told me earlier that he and his wife were raising their boys in a way that “blends the best of multiple cultures.” When Dylan jumped out of bed, Tolia asked if he would sing a Sanskrit prayer for me. Dylan sang Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger” instead. A little later, when asked again, he happily obliged. “Twameva mata cha pita twameva, twameva bandhush-cha sakha twameva,” he sang. The words, addressed to an eternal and universal God, loosely translate to “For you indeed are my mother, my father; you are my kin, my friend.” ', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/09/south-asian-american-stereotype-kondabolu-simpsons.html', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/magazine/rights-exempt/2018/09/south-asian-american/south-asian-americans-new-dream-11.jpg', '2018-09-04 12:30:25', 218, 3),

The former White House intern turned anti-bullying activist tweeted that there were agreed-upon parameters regarding the topics of her televised conversation Monday night with a well-known Israeli news anchor, following a conference speech she gave about the perils of the internet. Lewinsky called Yonit Levi''s first question about her relationship with Clinton a "blatant disregard for our agreement." Levi, the main anchor of Israel''s top-rated evening newscast, asked Lewinsky if she still expected a personal apology from Clinton over the fallout of the scandal of their affair 20 years ago. Lewinsky responded: "I''m so sorry. I''m not going to be able to do this." She then put down her microphone and walked offstage. Levi reached out her hand and then anxiously followed Lewinsky offstage as some of the stunned audience awkwardly clapped. The confused hosts then rushed opposition lawmaker Yair Lapid onstage to keep the event moving along. A smiling Lapid, who plans to challenge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the next Israeli elections, quipped: "Everything has happened to me but stepping in for Monica Lewinsky is a first. There is no way I''ll be interesting enough in the next few minutes but we''ll do our best." In a tweet several hours later, Lewinsky said she had been misled. "In fact, the exact question the interviewer asked first, she had put to me when we met the day prior. I said that was off limits," she explained. "I left because it is more important than ever for women to stand up for themselves and not allow others to control their narrative. To the audience: I''m very sorry that this talk had to end this way." Levi''s employer, the Israeli News Company, said it did its utmost to abide by all agreements made with Lewinsky. "The question asked was legitimate, worthy and respectful and in no way deviated from Ms. Lewinsky''s requests," said company spokesman Alon Shani. "We thank Ms. Lewinsky for her fascinating speech to the conference, respect her sensitivity and wish her all the best." Clinton recently came under fire for responding defensively to questions in an NBC interview about his sexual relationship with the White House intern in the late 1990s. He insisted he did not think it necessary to offer her a personal apology since he had already repeatedly apologized publicly. Clinton''s affair with Lewinsky helped lead to his impeachment. Lewinsky, who for years kept quiet about the relationship before re-emerging as a public speaker, wrote in March that their relationship "was not sexual assault" but "constituted a gross abuse of power."

Bush White House sparked the latest Democratic calls to delay confirmation hearings for President Trump''s high court pick.', 'WASHINGTON — Confirmation hearings for President Trump''s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh were to kick off in a politically charged Senate Tuesday morning, as a late-night release of tens of thousands of documents related to his time in the George W. Bush White House led to another Democratic call for a delay in the process. "A good judge must be an umpire — a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy..." Kavanaugh was expected to say, according to excerpts of his opening statement released Tuesday morning. "I don’t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences." The statement was to include praise for Merrick Garland, the Obama high court nominee whom Republicans did not grant a Senate hearing, with Kavanaugh calling him a "superb chief judge" and, along with the rest of the judges he serves with "a colleague and a friend." Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge based in Washington, is expected to face questions about whether he would overturn longstanding precedents, including the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision on abortion rights, Roe v. Wade. Democrats are also expected to grill Kavanaugh on his stance on executive power, his experience working with Clinton special prosecutor Ken Starr, and his time serving as White House staff secretary to President George W. Bush. The 53-year-old nominee will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday to listen to members’ opening statements and to deliver his own to the panel. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, will be among those who will formally introduce the nominee. Senate Democrats had called for a delay in Kavanaugh''s confirmation last month when Trump''s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violation and fraud charges, and when the president declined to rule out a pardon for Paul Manafort following the former Trump campaign manager''s conviction on tax fraud and other felony charges. They expressed concern about Kavanaugh''s comments about executive power because they said he could help protect the president on several fronts, particularly the Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Kavanaugh wrote in a Minnesota Law Review article in 2009 that it is “vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible.” “The country wants the President to be ''one of us'' who bears the same responsibilities of citizenship that all share. But I believe that the President should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office,” Kavanaugh wrote. He continued by arguing that President Bill Clinton could have lived without the distraction of the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and instead focused on Osama bin Laden. He also made comments at a 2016 event in which he said that a 1978 ruling that creates a system for independent counsels to investigate government officials for federal crimes should be overturned. President Trump nominated Kavanaugh in early July, not long after Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who had been considered the swing vote, announced his retirement. On Friday, the Trump administration announced that the White House pushed for the withholding of 100,000 documents from Kavanaugh’s White House record from Congress. “We’re witnessing a Friday night document massacre. President Trump’s decision to step in at the last moment and hide 100,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh’s records from the American public is not only unprecedented in the history of Supreme Court nominations, it has all the makings of a cover up,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement on Friday. Then, late Monday night, former president George W. Bush''s lawyer turned over 42,000 pages of documents from the nominee''s White House service, sparking an angry response from Schumer, who called yet again for a delay. “Not a single senator will be able to review these records before tomorrow,” he tweeted. The majority staff tweeted overnight that they had completed their review of all the documents. The Judiciary Committee has 430,000 documents on a confidential basis, which have been reviewed by the staff of Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Of that batch, 287,000 have been made public, with Democrats expressing concern that documents relating to Kavanaugh’s job as Bush’s staff secretary were not being handed over to lawmakers. The panel has asked that the National Archives produce presidential records from Kavanaugh’s service as an executive branch lawyer and when he worked for Starr. President Bush is also providing records on an expedited basis. The next two days will bring several rounds of question and answer exchanges between senators and Kavanaugh, with the final day expected to focus on panels of legal experts who have been invited by both the majority and minority. The witnesses invited by Democrats include John Dean, President Nixon’s White House counsel, who’s expected to discuss the abuse of executive power. Senate Republicans are aiming to confirm Kavanaugh by the end of September, in time for the Supreme Court’s next term in October. If every Democrat votes against him on the floor, Republicans can’t afford a single defection, especially now with the death of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. The red state Democrats up for re-election in November will be key in determining whether Kavanaugh is confirmed.

Closed poorly, too. And now he’s gone, beaten at the U.S. Open by an opponent ranked outside the top 50 for the first time in his career. Looking slow and tired on a sweltering night in Arthur Ashe Stadium, the No. 2-seeded Federer double-faulted 10 times, failed to convert a trio of set points and lost 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7), 7-6 (3) in the fourth round to John Millman in a match that began Monday and concluded at nearly 1 a.m. on Tuesday. It’s only the second time in Federer’s past 14 appearances at the U.S. Open that he’s lost before the quarterfinals. He is, after all, a five-time champion at the tournament, part of his men’s-record haul of 20 Grand Slam titles. “I have so much respect for Roger and everything he’s done for the game. He’s been a hero of mine, and today he was definitely not at his best,” Millman said, “but, you know, I’ll take it.” So much for that highly anticipated matchup between Federer and 13-time major champion Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. Instead, it’ll be the 55th-ranked Millman, an Australian who had never made it past the third round at a Slam until last week, taking on No. 6 seed Djokovic. Millman was adamant he would not be intimidated by Federer, and perhaps was helped by having spent time practicing together a few months ago ahead of the grass-court portion of this season. Still, this was a stunner. Not simply because Federer lost — he entered the day 28-0 at the U.S. Open, and 127-1 in all Grand Slam matches, against foes below No. 50 in the ATP rankings — but how he lost. Start with this: Federer held two set points while serving for the second at 5-4, 40-15 and did not pull through. Millman knew that was the turning point. Then Federer had a set point in the third at 6-5 in the tiebreaker, but again was stymied. In the fourth set, he went up a break at 4-2, yelling “Come on!” and getting all of those rowdy spectators in their “RF” gear on their feet, prompting the chair umpire to repeatedly plead for silence. But Federer uncharacteristically got broken right back with a sloppy game, most egregiously when he slapped what should have been an easy putaway into the net. In the final tiebreaker, he double-faulted twice in a row. Maybe the 75 percent humidity played a role. Millman’s big rips on groundstrokes didn’t help matters. As the unforced errors mounted — Federer would finish with 77, nearly three times as many as Millman’s 28 — Federer’s wife, Mirka, couldn’t bear to look, placing her forehead on her hands in the guest box in the stands. Federer hung his head at a changeover, a little black fan pointed right at his face, but nothing seemed to make him feel like himself. Hours before, Djokovic left the court for a medical timeout — the second time during the tournament he’s sought help from a doctor because of harsh weather — during what would become an otherwise straightforward 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory over 68th-ranked Joao Sousa of Portugal. He reached the quarterfinals for an 11th consecutive appearance in New York as he bids for a third U.S. Open championship and 14th Grand Slam trophy. The other quarterfinal on the bottom half of the draw will be a rematch of the 2014 U.S. Open final: No. 7 Marin Cilic against No. 21 Kei Nishikori. Cilic, who beat Nishikori four years ago for his only major title, was a 7-6 (6), 6-2, 6-4 winner against No. 10 David Goffin, while Nishikori advanced by defeating Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3, 6-2, 7-5.

All rights reserved. NEW YORK (AP) Maria Sharapova won the U.S. Open as a teenager. More than a decade later, she can’t seem to make it past the fourth round. With a mistake-filled performance, Sharapova lost a night match at Flushing Meadows for the first time in her lengthy career, beaten 6-4, 6-3 by No. 30 seed Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain on Monday. It’s the third consecutive appearance that ended one step short of the quarterfinals for the 31-year-old Sharapova, who had been 22-0 under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Sharapova collected the trophy in New York at age 19 in 2006 and owns a total of five Grand Slam titles, but the Russian was far shakier during this match than Suarez Navarro, who never has made it past the quarterfinals at a major. The Spaniard will be at that stage for the second time at the U.S. Open, five years after her other run to that round. On Wednesday, Suarez Navarro will face 2017 runner-up Madison Keys of the United States. Keys advanced by beating No. 29 Dominika Cibulkova 6-1, 6-3. Suarez Navarro let the 22nd-seeded Sharapova create her own problems. Sharapova had all sorts of trouble serving, repeatedly catching wayward ball tosses and committing eight double-faults. She was broken in six of her 10 service games. During lengthy exchanges from the baseline, Sharapova often blinked first, although a couple of times the righty managed to switch her racket to her left hand for a desperation shot to extend a point. While both women finished with 15 winners, Sharapova had nearly twice as many unforced errors as Suarez Navarro, 38-20. Since her championship, Sharapova has only once made it to the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open – in 2012, when she lost in the semifinals. Since then, the best she’s done are fourth-round exits in 2014, 2017 and 2018. Follow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich More AP tennis coverage: https://www.apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports NEW YORK (AP) Kei Nishikori was so crushed about missing the U.S. Open last year, he couldn’t even watch the tournament. Nishikori’s season was over with torn tendons in his right wrist, and he knew how much he’d ache to play if he flipped on the TV. “I didn’t really want to see any matches,” he said. A year later, Nishikori might want to catch some U.S. Open highlights. The Japanese standout still has some soreness in the wrist he hurt in August 2017, but it hasn’t slowed him down in his return to Flushing Meadows. Nishikori, the 2014 runner-up, beat Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3, 6-2, 7-5 on Monday to reach the final eight for a second straight Grand Slam tournament. Up next, a potential rematch of the `14 final against No. 7 seed Marin Cilic, who faced 10th-seeded David Goffin later Monday. Either way, the 28-year Nishikori hardly resembles the player he was in 2014 when he became the first man from Asia to reach a Grand Slam singles final. He altered his serve in the wake of the wrist injury. His confidence is soaring, too, after he reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. Naomi Osaka also reached the quarterfinals Monday, only the second time in the professional era that a Japanese man and woman reached that round at the same Grand Slam event. Shuzo Matsuoka and Kimiko Date did it at Wimbledon in 1995. “I always thought that if I can keep up with him, that would be really cool,” Osaka said. Four years ago, Nishikori recalled feeling upbeat before he played Cilic and was surprised he didn’t have a case of nerves. Once he hit Arthur Ashe Stadium, the magnitude of the moment hit him. “I wasn’t nervous before the match, but as soon as I got into the court, it was different,” he said. “I remember I wasn’t there for the match. Hopefully, I can come back to that stage.” Nishikori was worn down by the time he reached the final in a remarkable run where he defeated three of the top five seeds. He beat No. 5 Milos Raonic and No. 3 Stan Wawrinka in five sets in back-to-back matches totaling more than 8 1/2 hours. Then he upset No. 1 Novak Djokovic in four sets. Nishikori, coached by Michael Chang, needed four sets to beat Diego Schwartzman, but has two straight-set victories and didn’t even complete two full sets in another match because Gael Monfils retired with a wrist injury. Short and sweet – and staying strong in a deep run. “I don’t have any pressure,” Nishikori said. “But (I’m) enjoying playing every match and enjoying playing tennis again a little more than before.” The No. 21 seed returned to the tour early this year, building his confidence back with a victory in a Challenger Tour event, then reached the final in Monte Carlo and the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, where he lost to eventual champion Djokovic. His success may have eased the pressure, but a country is keeping tabs on him. Nishikori, the first Japanese man to be ranked in the ATP’s top 10, was a hero in his home country when he played in the U.S. Open final. In his hometown of Matsue, hundreds of fans packed into a convention hall to cheer him on at a standing-room-only public viewing event. Giant banners emblazoned with messages of encouragement hung on the walls. He feels at home in New York, where scores of Asians root for him, no matter the court or time of match, and he made a return trip to the semifinals in 2016.

Line said it plans to spend most of the money on promoting its Line Pay service and for other new financial services by the end of 2021. The messaging platform has been involved in payment offerings for some years, launching Line Pay at the end of 2014 — to let users make payments through the app at affiliated online and offline stores by registering their credit cards. Line Pay also supports p2p payments between users of the platform, which has some 164M monthly active users in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. While popular in parts of Asia, the messaging platform has failed to grow usage beyond its core regions — unsurprisingly given how fiercely competitive the space is — with the likes of China’s WeChat and Facebook owned WhatsApp standing in its way. But while user growth has stalled, Line has managed to grow revenue from its existing user base. And doubling down on financial services looks to be its growth strategy going forward. It has recently started experimenting with crypto — announcing the forthcoming launch of a cryptocurrency token (called Link) late last month, and developing its own blockchain to power it, in what looks to be a bid to drive user engagement on its platform. Though it has long used a digital currency (Line Coins) on its platform. Earlier this year Line also announced the launch of a Singapore-based crypto exchange, called BitBox. It’s not doing an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for the Link token launch, presumably to side-step the legal questions around token sales. So the convertible bond sale looks to be its alternative (traditional) route for raise funds for the push to grow its financial services business. In a statement today Line said it would issue zero coupon convertible bonds maturing in 2023 and 2025. Reuters reports that a portion of the bonds will be issued to its South Korea-based parent Naver Corp to maintain its ownership above a certain level. It added that Naver’s stake would fall to 70.42 percent from the current 72.86 percent when all the bonds are converted into stock.

(168, 'Inside Facebook''s ''arms race'' to protect users ahead of midterm elections', 'NBC News got an exclusive look inside Facebook''s "arms race" to protect users against false news and foreign interference ahead of America''s midterm elections.', 'Inside Facebook’s Menlo Park, California, headquarters, it is all hands on deck to fight one of the toughest battles the social media giant has ever faced. The mission is to protect Facebook''s and Instagram’s billions of users from more foreign interference in their news feed during the upcoming midterm elections. During the 2016 presidential election, over 126 million Americans were exposed to incendiary posts from Russia-linked accounts, pages, and ads. Samidh Chakrabarti is the product manager of Civic Engagement at Facebook. He is leading company-wide efforts to secure Facebook’s platform for elections around the world, including the upcoming U.S. midterm elections. It’s a directive that comes from CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg, who has thus far declined to say how much foreign interference is currently present on Facebook. With less than two months to go, Chakrabarti said Facebook is “much more effective than we used to be” and the entire company is “laser focused on getting it right.” He also revealed new details on Facebook’s plans to build a physical "war room" to coordinate a real-time response to nefarious activity during the midterms. NBC News Business Correspondent Jo Ling Kent interviewed Chakrabarti exclusively for a story on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt. Here is a condensed transcript of the interview with Chakrabarti, edited for length and clarity: JO LING KENT: We''re just two months away from the midterm elections. Former [Facebook] chief security officer, Alex Stamos, has come forward saying that it is actually too late to protect the U.S. midterms. What''s your response to that? SAMIDH CHAKRABARTI: Well, we''ve been at this for a while. So we''ve been working on this for quite a while. And we''ve been mobilizing a huge cross-company effort. Really every single corner of this company has mobilized to making sure that we''re laser-focused and that we get it right. And so our efforts are really focused on four main areas. The first is around combating foreign interference, the second is around blocking and removing fake accounts on our platform, the third is around slowing the spread of misinformation and fake news on the platform, and then the last area is around bringing an unprecedented level of transparency to political ads on our platform. KENT: What do you say to an individual out there who is concerned about what''s happening in the lead-up to the midterm elections, but they also go to Facebook every single day to consume and to share? CHAKRABARTI: I''d say we''re working around the clock to make sure that our platform is secure during times of elections. And, you know, we''ve been making a lot of progress. As an example, in a six-month period, we actually detected, blocked, and removed, over a billion fake accounts before they could do anything like spread fake news or misinformation. So that''s one example of the rapid progress that we''ve been making in this area. KENT: What are some of the tactics and strategies that you''re using to make sure people can be safe on Facebook and get information that''s true and factual? CHAKRABARTI: One example from how we''re combating foreign interference is that we basically have some of the best intelligence analysts from around the world working to discover coordinated influence operations on our platform. And we’ve made many announcements in the last several weeks about how we''ve been removing tens of thousands of fake pages, fake profiles, groups, and so forth that have been trying to engage in coordinated operations. So we''re just getting better and faster at detecting bad actors on the platform and removing them. KENT: How are the "bad actors" now in 2018 different than they were in 2015, ''16, and ’17? CHAKRABARTI: We''re looking all around the world to make sure that this same kind of playbook that bad actors used in 2016 is not used again. We are staying ever vigilant, looking everywhere for this kind of activity as a means of stopping it. And I think a lot of the work that we''re doing, for example, around political ad transparency, helps prevent this kind of behavior. With political ad transparency, we''re making it so that anybody who sees a political ad on Facebook can see who is behind that ad and who paid for that ad. I think that helps create a much more trustworthy environment for political discourse on our platforms. …It is an arms race. And we''re always working to try to stay one step ahead. As an example, the bad actors out there have gotten more sophisticated. They''re better at hiding their location... So we also have gotten better at finding when people are trying to hide their location. KENT: President Donald Trump has come out criticizing big technology companies, Facebook included. He said, "Facebook, they''re really treading on very, very troubled territory. And they have to be careful." The president went on to say, "It''s not fair to large portions of the population." How do you interpret a statement like that from the president of the United States criticizing Facebook? CHAKRABARTI: The way that I think about it is I go back to what is the mission of Facebook? You know, we really do want to give everybody a voice and bring the world closer together. And so what that means to us is that we want to make sure our platform is a great place for people to express themselves across the entire political spectrum. And we work to make sure that our platforms can support that, because if they don''t, then we''re not actually going to be able to realize our mission of bringing the world closer together. We want all voices to be represented. KENT: Is Facebook discriminating against conservatives? There''s a lot of concern on that front right now. CHAKRABARTI: I think we just try to make sure that the platform is a place that''s agnostic of people''s political views. And really there is a thriving conversation taking place on Facebook. Any part of the political spectrum that you look at, there are thriving conversations taking place on Facebook. KENT: How did you detect that activity coming out of Russia and Iran? And how quickly were you able to bring it down? CHAKRABARTI: I think one important thing to understand is that we''re not doing this alone. We''re not doing this by ourselves. We''re just one small part of a much bigger puzzle. We''ve been working with governments around the world, with security experts around the world, with civic society around the world to share information about threats that we see. And we bring those together and we put our best intelligence investigators on it to find that kind of activity on our platform and take it down. So, it''s only by working with other people that we can solve these kinds of problems. KENT: What is it like inside headquarters as you''re detecting this activity? You''re deploying so much effort, yet forces continue to try to violate the community standards. CHAKRABARTI: I think it''s just the reality of work in this space. This is an area where there are determined and sophisticated adversaries, who are always going to try to circumvent measures that we put in place. And that''s precisely why we''ve made such massive investment in this space. You know, we''ve really grown our safety and security team from 10,000 people a year ago to 20,000 people today. And so that is the kind of commitment that we''re showing to this. And it''s really to the point that we''ve even said before, that it''s going to impact our profitability, because we take our responsibility so seriously that we''re willing to make that level of investment. KENT: When you add 10,000 people to the security team, what exactly are their roles? What are they doing? CHAKRABARTI: They''re doing a lot of things. This is a huge cross-company effort that requires people of many different disciplines coming together to solve these kinds of problems. And so we have people who are trained intelligence investigators. We also have people who are some of the best computational data scientists in the world, who can find needles in a haystack using advanced artificial intelligence. And so those are the kinds of roles that we all put together in order to do this, because, really, that''s what it takes. KENT: How much do you work with your counterparts at Twitter and Google and other platforms to coordinate a response to fight bad actors? CHAKRABARTI: As an example, with the takedowns that we did just a few weeks ago, we''ve been working with our industry partners on this, exchanging information. And that has really yielded a lot of benefits. The benefit that we see is we are able to get more information about particular bad actors and then we''re able to take them off of the platform. And we can similarly, reciprocally, provide that kind of help to others in the industry. KENT: Facebook is building a war room, a "situation room,” a rapid response team of sorts in the final weeks leading up to the election. What is that going to look like? Why are you doing that? CHAKRABARTI: We have many measures that we''ve put in place to try to prevent problems: the political ad transparency, blocking fake accounts, combating foreign interference, and preventing the spread of misinformation. But we know we have to be ready for anything that happens. And so that''s why we''ve been building this war room, a physical war room [with] people across the company, of all different disciplines, who are there. So, as we discover problems that may come up in the hours leading up to the election, we can take quick and decisive action. KENT: Is Facebook a safer platform now in 2018 compared to the lead-up to the 2016 election? CHAKRABARTI: I believe we''ve been making very rapid progress in all of these areas: Combating foreign interference, making sure that we can block and remove fake accounts, stopping the spread of misinformation and fake news on the platform, and then also bringing more transparency to political ads. I think we are in a much better place than we were in 2016. But it is an arms race. And so that''s why we''re remaining ever vigilant, laser focused to make sure that we can stay ahead of new problems that emerge. This is going to be a never-ending process and that''s exactly why we''re investing so much in both people and technology -- to be as prepared as possible for the midterms. KENT: There has been a very vocal critic out there [former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, Tristan Harris] who said that 2016 at Facebook left behind a living, breathing crime scene. What''s your response to that for 2018? Will it not be the case? CHAKRABARTI: In 2016, we saw new kinds of threats that we hadn''t seen before. And that''s why we''ve been mobilizing this huge effort across the company. Every single corner of this company is just remaining laser focused and taking our role really seriously. To make sure that this can be a safe place for political discourse. KENT: Do you sense that the efforts now that Facebook is deploying to fight disinformation and fake news are working? CHAKRABARTI: I think we''re much more effective than we used to be, in this regard.

(170, 'Haqqani network''s founder dies after long illness, Afghan Taliban says', 'The network Haqqani founded has been behind some of the bloodiest attacks against U.S. and NATO troops and civilians in Afghanistan.', 'PESHAWAR, Pakistan — The founder of the Haqqani network, the group behind some of the bloodiest attacks against U.S. and NATO troops and civilians in Afghanistan, has died after a long illness, according to the Afghan Taliban. Jalaluddin Haqqani created the militant organization bearing his name in the 1970s and but relinquished leadership to his son some years ago. The Haqqanis are an integral part of the Afghan Taliban. In a statement announcing his death, the Afghan Taliban called Haqqani a "prominent jihadi figure, religious scholar, exemplary warrior and pioneer of celebrated jihads." It said he had been suffering a long illness and bedridden for several years. There were previous widespread reports of his death in 2015. The elder Haqqani wasn''t always an enemy of the U.S. In the 1980s he was among the Afghan mujahedeen, or holy warriors, who were backed by Washington to fight against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Haqqani was also a close friend of al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden''s and was aged 72 when he died, according to the Associated Press. Reuters put his age at 71. The Haqqani network was also behind a spate of high-profile abductions, including holding Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl captive after deserting his post in 2009. Caitlan Coleman, an American who was pregnant when she and her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle were kidnapped by militants while in Afghanistan in late 2012, were held by the Haqqanis for five years. The family was freed last year. Haqqani''s military prowess brought him attention from both the United States and Pakistan when Washington backed an uprising against the communist government in Kabul and its Russian allies during the 1980s. He received both money and weapons from the U.S. Haqqani was praised by the late U.S. Congressman Charlie Wilson as "goodness personified." After taking power in Afghanistan in September 1996, the Taliban embraced Haqqani for his military skills, according to a declassified 1998 cable from the U.S. Embassy. That cable also said Haqqani "is close buddies with many Arab and Pakistani Islamists." In August 1998, U.S. cruise missiles targeted Haqqani''s base in a failed attempt to kill bin Laden. Declassified U.S. cables called Haqqani a "moderate socialist" who did not embrace the Taliban''s strict rules that denied girls education, the AP reported. Due to the Haqqanis'' wealth and deep links to local tribes, one Western diplomat once called them "the Kennedys of the Taliban movement." His group became notorious for complex, well-organized attacks on both Afghan and U.S. military. More than 2,400 American personnel and tens of thousands of local residents have died in Afghanistan''s near 17-year war. Jalaluddin Haqqani''s son, Sirajuddin, currently is in charge of the Haqqani network and also serves as deputy leader of the Afghan Taliban. He has a $5 million bounty on his head. Mushtaq Yusufzai reported from Peshawar, and Alexander Smith from London.

Ms Lewinsky said there were agreed-upon parameters regarding the topics of her conversation about the perils of the internet and said Ms Levi had shown "blatant disregard for our agreement" by asking about Mr Clinton. Ms Levi asked Ms Lewinsky if she still expected a personal apology from the former president over the fallout from the scandal of their affair 20 years ago. Ms Lewinsky responded: "I''m so sorry. I''m not going to be able to do this." She then put down her microphone and walked offstage. Ms Lewinsky, who is now an anti-bullying activist, took to Twitter to explain what happened. “There were clear parameters about what we would be discussing and what we would not,” she said. “In fact, the exact question the interview asked first, she had put to me when we met the day prior.

(176, 'MAD ABOUT TRUMP', 'Two Americas, two political parties in upheaval and the midterm elections around the corner: The president loves it.', 'Donald Trump’s drastic and ongoing reconfiguration of the political landscape shows no signs of subsiding as November’s midterm elections approach. This special report two months before the pivotal vote examines the impact of Trumpism on both political parties — their leaders, their candidates and their activists — as well as how it’s disrupting the political culture for voters. Trump’s 2016 election and his presidency has been a cataclysm — an abrupt and brutal destruction of the existing political order. That’s been satisfying for Trump voters. They clamored for a top-to-bottom shake-up of the status quo. Democrats frame his victory and its aftermath as a clarion call for action, while a class of lost Republican elites hopes the president’s seizure of the GOP is an anomaly from which their beloved party will someday recover. Through dozens of interviews, an exclusive poll, an NBC News analysis of candidate websites and more, the picture has become clear: Democrats are moving further left; Republicans are gravitating toward Trump; and the voters increasingly disdain anyone who doesn’t agree with them. This is the story of a jostled American electorate on the cusp of rendering its midterm judgment on the Trump presidency. That verdict will shape the final two years of his first term and provide valuable markers for the early contours of the 2020 political battleground that will decide whether the president will have four more years. OMAHA, Neb. — A gay bar may not be a typical campaign stop in ruby-red Nebraska. But progressive upstart candidate Kara Eastman beat the typical Nebraska Democrat in a primary earlier this year, so one warm summer evening, she showed up at Flixx, a fixture of the nightclub scene in downtown Omaha, to greet supporters. “There are people who are skeptical about an actual, unapologetic Democrat, running on a Democratic platform, because they’ve been trained to believe that this is not a winning strategy for this district,” Eastman, a social worker who runs a nonprofit, said in an interview. “I believe it is the winning strategy for this district. We have to ignite this base.” With her all-in progressive platform of Medicare for All, free college and stricter gun control, Eastman breaks every rule about how Democrats should run in a place like Omaha. But after the 2016 election left her party with less power in Washington and in state capitals than it had in nearly a century, the old rules are being questioned. Eastman is emblematic of the progressives, women and political newcomers who are remaking the Democratic Party for the post-Clinton-Obama era, outraged by Donald Trump’s election and fueled by a backlash to his administration’s actions. As progressives see it, the half-loaf incrementalism preached by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton had one job — to win — and it failed, so what good is it now? Better to demand it all, they say, and ask moderates to compromise, just as in the past moderates have asked progressives to move toward the middle. “The question is always, ‘How are you going to get the Republicans to vote for you?’ The answer is we’re not,” said Crystal Rhoades, a close Eastman ally who leads the Douglas County Democratic Party, which includes Omaha. That kind of thinking unnerves traditional Democrats, like the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which backed Eastman’s opponent in the primary but ultimately decided to get behind her in the general election. Some in the party see a rare opportunity to welcome disaffected refugees from Trump’s GOP, but progressives like Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who won the Democratic primary for a House seat in New York City, are more interested in capitalizing on the surging energy in their own base. “It’s never been done here before,” Rhoades acknowledged. “We finally have a crop of candidates nationwide who are saying the things that need to be said, and they’re doing so unabashedly.” For years, Rhoades has been trying to convince her colleagues that Democrats in Omaha are no different from Democrats in Los Angeles, so the party is better off giving its base what it wants than sacrificing its liberal values to try to win over Republicans. Just as the tea party movement led to a reawakening of the right after eight years of Republican control of the White House, from 2001 to January 2009, the anti-Trump “resistance” has reinvigorated the left. Progressives are protesting against their own party’s leaders and shifting the policy debate to the left, and the so-called establishment is listening. Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, even declared that Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described Democratic Socialist, “represents the future of our party” after she unseated a powerful congressman in a primary. Jake Sullivan, the top policy adviser in Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, recently offered a mea culpa for not recognizing that the country was ready for a more muscular progressivism than he had anticipated. “I have to confess that I did not fully appreciate the need for a more dramatic rethink at the start of the 2016 campaign,” he wrote in a lengthy essay for the journal Democracy. Trump has only supercharged a hard shift to the left that was already under way. When the president tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, liberals responded by calling for single-payer health care. When Trump separated migrant families at the border, the left called for the abolition of ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The most telling ideological shift in the party is the explosion of support for Medicare for All, an idea Clinton had dismissively brushed aside during the Democratic presidential primary two years ago as a “theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass.” In 2016, 62 Democrats in the House co-sponsored the main Medicare for All bill, which would replace the current health insurance system with a single-payer one. Now, more than 120 Democrats have signed on — nearly two-thirds of the caucus. Single-payer health care has become the critical litmus test for any Democrat who wants to be seen as a progressive. Bernie Sanders used to be its only supporter in the Senate, but when he rolled out an updated version of the bill last year, he was joined by a who’s who of ambitious Senate Democrats: Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand — all potential presidential hopefuls in 2020. And it’s not just those usual-suspect liberals. Converts include at least four members of the moderate Blue Dog coalition and former Sen. Max Baucus, whom liberals blame for watering down the Affordable Care Act. On social issues, there is now virtual unanimity among Democrats at the federal level on abortion rights and LGBTQ equality, in a way that would have been difficult to imagine just a few years ago. Obama didn’t back gay marriage until May 2012, deep into his first term and six months before he faced re-election. As African-Americans have demanded more recognition from a party they loyally support, opposition to overhauling the criminal justice system has melted away. And on immigration, Obama’s deportations and Clinton’s opposition to driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants now seem anachronistic as the party increasingly backs sanctuary policies and pro-immigrant positions to counter Trump. (Perhaps feeling the winds of change, Clinton announced she supported driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants in 2015.) Of course, moderates warn that the approach could end disastrously for Democrats, plunging the party into a 1970s and ʼ80s-style political slump. When Walter Mondale lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan in 1984, whites made up 85.5 percent of reported voters and self-identified “conservatives” vastly outnumbered those calling themselves “liberals.” Today, 73.3 percent of reported voters are white. And while the ranks of liberals in the party are rising fast, the number of Democrats who consider themselves conservative is falling. Inside the party, the shift has come as it loses its former strongholds in the South, rural areas and small blue-collar cities. Meanwhile, Trump has stripped Democrats of their interest in compromise. The number of liberals in the Democratic Party is increasing, while conservatives and moderates are shrinking. The historical gap in which Democrats favored compromise more than Republicans has disappeared. The historical gap in which Democrats favored compromise more than Republicans has disappeared. The number of liberals in the Democratic Party is increasing, while conservatives and moderates are shrinking. The number of liberals in the Democratic Party is increasing, while conservatives and moderates are shrinking. The historical gap in which Democrats favored compromise more than Republicans has disappeared. For years, Democrats were far more likely than Republicans to say they wanted politicians who would work with the other side to get things done, but that gap has disappeared, according to the Pew Research Center. When the freshmen of the 116th Congress assemble on the steps of the Capitol in January for their class photo, the most notable difference from every portrait hanging next to it will probably be the number of women present. There are now more women running, donating and winning primaries than ever. That surge is limited to the Democratic side, two years after a man accused of sexual assault beat the first woman nominated for president by a major party, a result that helped give rise to the #MeToo movement. “Women are tired of handing their politics over to men and seeing it not get done,” said Jane Kleeb, the chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party. “Women have reached their tipping point.” That helps explain Eastman’s win, Kleeb said, and it helps explain numerous other races where women beat expectations to win Democratic primaries this year. Women have won about 65 percent of Democratic primaries this year for open House, Senate and governor seats that included at least one man and one women, according to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight. In 2012 and 2014, women were about equally likely to donate to Democratic candidates or liberal groups as they were to Republican and conservative ones. As of earlier this year, however, 68 percent of women’s political contributions are going to Democratic candidates or liberal groups, according to Open Secrets, a project of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks money in American politics. The force powering all of this, of course, is the backlash to Trump. “I shouldn’t thank him, but I do,” said Precious McKesson, a community organizer in heavily African-American North Omaha, the birthplace of Malcolm X. McKesson was deeply involved with social welfare groups in her community, but she didn’t pay close attention to politics until after the 2016 election, when she noticed the drop-off in votes from African-Americans. She complained to party officials that Democrats had a habit of ignoring black voters until election season — “we’re the break-glass-in-case-of-emergency vote,” she said — so the state party put her in charge of outreach to the community. Two years ago, she supported Clinton, like the vast majority of black Democrats. “But if I could go back and do it again, I would very definitely vote for Bernie,” she said of Sen. Bernie Sanders,  the Vermont independent  who challenged Clinton in the primary and may run again for the White House in 2020. McKesson is just one of thousands of Americans who became political activists — and candidates — because of Trump. For the first time in years, Democrats have fielded candidates in every congressional district in states like Texas and Alabama, where they used to not even bother competing. Three years ago, just 19 percent of Republican lawmakers were facing Democratic challengers who had raised at least $50,000, a sign of viability. At the same point in this cycle, 58 percent of GOP incumbents faced challengers who met that threshold. ActBlue, which processes online payments for most Democratic candidates and groups, has run out of superlatives as they smash through fundraising record after record. That enthusiasm and energy will be the hardest thing for Democrats to sustain. And many worry the party’s leftward lurch will be an even bigger liability for Democrats in 2020 and perhaps beyond. “We have a tendency to alienate rather than to welcome,” said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the chairman of the moderate New Democrat Coalition. But for Eastman, the realignment is worth the risk. “I always thought people like me don’t get elected,” she said. “But I think people are looking for authenticity and integrity in their candidates. You might not agree with me on every issue, but I won’t lie to you, and I have nothing to hide.” INDIANAPOLIS — On drives to visit his timber properties around Jasper, Indiana, in late 2015 and early 2016, Mike Braun began to see “signs” that a wealthy businessman with relatively little political experience could capture the imagination of Republican voters. The signs said “Trump.” And they cost $16 for a set of two on the Trump campaign website. Braun, who was serving in the state legislature at the time, marveled that a candidate could become fashionable enough to sell campaign placards. “I mean, people are not going to pay for a sign for any politician unless there was something going on,” Braun, who is now the GOP’s Senate nominee in Indiana, said in an interview with NBC News. Locked in a tight race that could help determine which party controls the chamber come January, Braun, who defeated two Republican congressmen in the May primary to earn a shot at Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, has grasped a simple truth: The ethos of modern Republican voters is a tribal loyalty to Trump. “Trump does not go simply for the intellect, but also the gut and the heart,” Steve Bannon, who served as chief executive on Trump’s campaign and then as a top adviser at the White House, said in an interview. The Republican Party is vastly different now than it was from GOP presidential primaries dating back at least as far as George H.W. Bush. The shifts, manifested most obviously in Republicans’ drastically increased antipathy toward the federal government, didn’t happen overnight. But Trump, unencumbered by decades of votes in Congress or a policy record as a governor, came along at just the right time to capitalize on, and accelerate, them. He represents an apotheosis of the tea party, and, with his primary and general election victories, he largely subsumed that movement into his political base. Victory also brought along a substantial portion of the establishment of the GOP. Trump’s approval rating among Republicans stood at 88 percent in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted in July, a staggering figure for a president whose standing with the broader electorate remains underwater. “He changed the Republican Party by just winning, quite frankly, an election that most of us thought we probably were not going to win,” said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a former chief of staff of the Republican National Committee. “In my last election, I got 70 percent and he got 66 in my district, and if we get into an argument, he’ll keep his 66 and I’ll keep my 4.” Braun has bet his candidacy on Indiana voters retaining their enthusiasm for Trump, whom they favored by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016. Braun’s key to beating Donnelly, who won his seat the same year Republican Mitt Romney beat President Barack Obama by 10 points in Indiana, is making sure base GOP voters come to the polls without alienating moderates so much that they cross the aisle to re-elect Donnelly. For each GOP nominee in a competitive House, Senate or gubernatorial race, that calculus is a little different. It depends on the leanings of the district or state, as well as those of the candidate. One variable, even on heavily Republican turf, is the degree to which candidates emulate Trump’s histrionics, as Rick Saccone did in losing a House special election in western Pennsylvania and Brian Kemp did in winning Georgia’s GOP gubernatorial nomination. Some, like Braun, have chosen to embrace the president’s anti-Washington message and his policies but not his idiosyncrasies. In Indiana, a state with a strong Republican lean and Midwestern sensibilities, Braun says he’s in line with the “essence” of Trump, but not the president’s style. Trump has shown a knack for giving political thrills to nearly all the factions within the Republican Party, plus a set of Trump Democrats who share his nationalist views on immigration, trade and foreign policy. For example, he demonstrated his support for Israel by deciding to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, an important sign for the evangelical Christians who are the swing voters of GOP primaries — capable of voting for candidates across the ideological spectrum and whose participation levels in general elections can make the difference between victory and defeat for Republicans. Trump’s shorthand for cracking down on illegal immigration is “build the wall,” which capitalizes on a long-running push from hard-liners to address border crossings with a physical barrier, and plays on fears of immigrants among some Republican voters. Much of his talk on cultural matters, from NFL players who don’t stand for the national anthem to the intelligence of prominent African-Americans, activates racial resentments among some of his supporters. But among supporters, if he has to change his position on an issue, they will move with him. “They’re prepared to understand that he’s going to have tactical retreats now and then,” Bannon said. Noting that Trump is pushing the GOP toward a brand of populist nationalism that was anathema to previous party heads, Bannon said, “He’s the only political leader in the country who’s trying to take his base to a different place.” On one hand, major elements of Trump’s “America First” framework represent an effort to redirect the whole of the Republican Party away from multilateral trade, liberalized immigration laws and dollar diplomacy. But on the other hand, Trump was also able to articulate a vision for the country that merged seamlessly with existing trends inside the party. His “drain the swamp” attack on Washington came the same year Gallup polling showed that 82 percent of Republicans believed the federal government had too much power, compared with 39 percent in 2002. (In 2017, 66 percent said they believe the government has too much power.) Over the same time period, the share of Democrats who think that has remained steady. And on issues of personal morality, the GOP has, along with Democrats, become much more accepting of divorce, having children out of wedlock and other social issues. Those trends explain why the “family values” party nominated and elected a twice-divorced man on his third marriage and has stuck with him despite allegations that he paid hush money to two women who claim they had affairs with him. The Republican movement on Trump’s signature issue — immigration — has been smaller, but significant enough to yield a clear majority of GOP support for clamping down. Those numbers also don’t capture the much more clear aversion Republican voters have to illegal immigration, which is evident in near-universal GOP support for Trump’s wall, even among voters who are comfortable with creating a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who are currently in the country. Trump’s temperament isn’t always popular with Republicans, but the policy outcomes of his presidency have unified the GOP. “They see all the things that have flowed out of that: Supreme Court appointments, the tax cut, probably the most deregulatory Congress in modern American history,” Cole said. Tom Schultz has numbers that explain why Trump’s critics feel so frustrated when they see him get a pass from GOP voters and lawmakers after he takes a position seemingly at odds with his base or long-standing conservative orthodoxy. Schultz, who was the data director for the 2016 presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and now works as vice president for digital and analytics at the conservative Club for Growth, found that the majority of GOP voters want Republicans in Congress to support Trump’s policies, even when the voters themselves disagree with those policies. He’s measured that sentiment using a proprietary “Trump Tribalism” score based on an index of voter responses to various questions, including the degree to which they change their own responses on issues based on where Trump stands on them — regardless of whether it’s to the left or right of their initial feeling. Braun, the Indiana Senate candidate, demonstrated in July how that works. Just before Trump announced he would extend $12 billion in subsidies to help farmers offset the pain of retaliation against his tariffs, Braun told NBC News he opposed an infusion of federal funds into the agricultural sector. The next morning, Braun sent a statement to NBC saying he supported Trump’s subsidies. The reversal, from a Trump-aligned candidate for the Senate, was a perfect example of the dynamic Schultz has measured among the president’s backers. “There’s clearly a large segment of Republican voters who value loyalty to Trump above all else,” Schultz said. At this point, there’s little argument among Republican and Democratic political strategists that Trump has consolidated his party’s base as completely as any president of either party has ever done. The question heading into the midterms is whether turnout, which tends to play a bigger role than in presidential elections, will help Republicans keep control of the House and Senate. Gallup data suggest that while Trump’s base of supporters is locked in, so are his critics in both  parties. Indeed, his approval ratings have been more static — and lower — than any president since Harry Truman. That’s true despite unambiguously strong economic indicators, from a stock market that has soared during his presidency to stunningly low unemployment numbers and a second-quarter GDP growth rate of 4.2 percent — the highest in four years. Because of Trump’s loyal base, there’s little choice for most Republican candidates but to stick with him. To show a degree of distance, Braun emphasizes that his style is much more humble and less bombastic than the president’s. In Indiana, where the Republican tilt is strong — as it is in several other states with toss-up marquee races, including Montana, North Dakota, Missouri and West Virginia — that might be enough if the GOP base is motivated to go to the polls. And Trump, who clearly understands he is the overarching issue in the midterms, is leaving nothing to chance. He said that he plans to spend six to seven days a week on the campaign trail from Labor Day to Election Day, working to energize his backers on behalf of Republican candidates. For them to take advantage, many will make the same gamble that Braun has: leave no daylight between themselves and a Trump agenda that fully defines the modern GOP, even when it changes. In a show of just how much his candidacy reflects the sentiment of Republican base voters, Braun paused for a few beats before answering whether there’s any issue on which he disagrees with Trump. WASHINGTON — For Sen. Marco Rubio, the rise of Trump prompted an existential crisis. “My whole life I have been told no matter how you may feel about someone, you respect everyone because we are all children of the same God,” the Florida Republican said at one of the last events of his presidential run two years ago. “Now being respectful to one another is considered political correctness.” Political scientists think Rubio is onto something. Voters can stay connected to news 24/7 through their phones, but they’re living more isolated lives politically, geographically and socially — and, increasingly, they just don’t like one another. Researchers interviewed by NBC News say this development is the most important factor undergirding American politics. It’s called “negative partisanship” and it’s a phenomenon in which voters base their decisions less on which party they like and more on which party they fear and loathe. “The most consequential trend in American public opinion in at least the last 20 years is people’s increasing dislike for the other side,” said Carolyn Roush, a fellow at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the Harvard Kennedy School. “That far precedes 2016.” Negative partisanship is one of a series of trends that continue to reshape politics in 2018. Americans have become more partisan, but also more distrustful of the two major political parties, whose power has been challenged by grass-roots movements from below and deep-pocketed donors from above. Candidates on the left have become more consistently liberal, while those on the right have turned more consistently conservative, giving citizens a clearer choice but making compromise once in office more difficult and political conversations more heated. For decades, researchers have conducted “thermometer” surveys asking Americans to gauge their warmth toward various groups and political actors, often on a 1-100 scale. People’s view of their own party has remained relatively consistent at a comfortable temperature of about 70 degrees. But in recent years, their rating of the other side has plummeted: Republican and Democratic voters pegged the rival party at a frigid record low 23 degrees in 2016, according to data from American National Election Studies compiled by Emory University political scientists Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster, down from the mid-40s in 1980. The NBC News/SurveyMonkey thermometer poll found that 49 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters gave the other party a “zero” rating in July, a spike from 39 percent who did so in a January 2016 poll. Republican contempt for the other side remained steady, with 42 percent of GOP or GOP-leaning respondents giving the Democratic Party a “zero” rating. This may feel intuitive to those watching campaigns play out: Trump has bashed his GOP leaders and flip-flopped on policy while maintaining strong support from his party. Republicans unite behind his relentless attacks on shared targets like Hillary Clinton, NFL protesters and immigrants, which have carried over to 2018 campaigns with similar messages. On the Democratic side, close to 60 House candidates this year have indicated they will not support Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for speaker if they win the House, with little apparent penalty from Democratic voters eager to challenge Trump’s agenda. There’s a debate about what is causing this shift toward more divisive campaigns. Part of it is that, as this year’s candidates demonstrate, parties are easier to distinguish. It’s hard to imagine today, but not long ago a significant minority of Republican voters were rated in issue surveys as more liberal than the median Democrat voter and a slice of Democratic voters were rated as more conservative than the median GOP voter. You can see this in the sharp decline of “ticket splitting,” where a voter picks one party for the White House but the other party for Congress or governor. The number of congressional split-ticket districts hit a record low in 2012 and was only marginally higher in the last election. And 2016 was the first time that voters chose the same party for Senate and president in every single state, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics. The candidates reflect this declining pool of swing voters as well — even relative centrists running in 2018 check most major boxes on party policy. In many conservative-leaning states, you can find progressive candidates like Rep. Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic Senate nominee in Texas. In a more extreme case on the other side, the GOP’s nominee in blue-leaning Virginia, Corey Stewart, is a Confederate flag enthusiast popular with white nationalists. But much of the divide goes beyond individual issues and toward racial, religious, geographic and class identity. Rural, evangelical and white voters without a college education are much more likely to be Republican. Nonwhite, urban and college-educated voters are much more likely to be Democrats. There’s also a massive generation gap that didn’t exist in elections as recently as 2000. A Pew Research survey in March found 59 percent of millennial voters identify or lean Democratic while 52 percent of voters in the Silent Generation (those in their 70s and 80s) identify or lean Republican. “Partisanship is increasingly connected with deeper divisions in American society,” said Abramowitz, the political scientist at Emory University who studies polarization. “It’s almost impossible to reach across the aisle because the differences are so great.” With faith, ethnicity and geography becoming bigger predictors of one’s vote, elections are also becoming stand-ins for more personal feelings, rather than choices about policy. Voters increasingly see their selection of a candidate as an affirmation of their core identity and a vote for the opposing party as an attack on that identity. Seventy-one percent of voters in the NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll believe a person’s political views “say a lot about their character,” including 80 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of Republicans. A substantial minority of partisans, especially Democrats, also report misgivings about relationships with people from the opposite party. Thirty-six percent of Democrats say they’re “not too comfortable” or “not at all comfortable” having close Republican friends. Twenty-one percent of Republicans report the same about Democrats. “We have these very negative perceptions of other side and don’t want to associate with them,” said Abramowitz, the Emory professor. Having parties with such stark differences can make politics more brutal. But it also can make choices more coherent, and there are plenty of voters, activists and politicians who aren’t mourning the good old days of center-right and center-left senators hammering out deals over drinks. On the left, Democrats see an opportunity to rally behind more sweeping proposals on issues like health care and immigration without having to worry about alienating right-leaning Democrats or attracting a Republican swing voter or two. As the party becomes less reliant on conservative white voters, activists also see an opportunity to put issues of racial justice and equality on the agenda in ways that party leaders might have previously discouraged. “The fact that you have Stacey Abrams leading the ticket in Georgia, I can’t even imagine something like that happening 25 years ago,” said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund. Abrams, a Democrat, is the first black woman to win a major party nomination for governor and has run an unabashedly progressive campaign. And true to national trends, her opponent Brian Kemp is proudly running as a “politically incorrect conservative”  — he has run ads in which he points a gun at a teenage boy who is dating his daughter and pledges to personally “round up criminal illegals” in his truck. On the Republican side, some see the party’s hard right turn on immigration as more reflective of its base, whose demands had previously been bottled up by donors and party leaders in favor of less popular ideas like cutting Medicare and Social Security benefits to balance the budget. “The No. 1 thing that’s changed since 2016 is that the party has migrated to better reflect the views of its actual voters,” said John Feehery, a former House Republican leadership aide. Others, especially with more heterodox politics, feel left behind in the shuffle. Reed Galen climbed the heights of Republican politics, following George W. Bush from the governor’s mansion in Texas as a 2000 campaign staffer to the White House as an aide and later serving as deputy campaign manager on John McCain’s 2008 presidential run. His politics were a mix — he veered further left on guns than most of his fellow Texans, for example — but Bush appealed to him with his emphasis on education and positive spin on immigration. After 2016, however, Galen decided he was no longer welcome in either party. “Trump was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he said. “If this is what it takes to be a Republican or to win a Republican nomination, this isn’t who I want to be.” So he tried another route: He joined a handful of other disaffected Bush veterans and a Wall Street backer to launch a small third-party group, the Serve America Movement, in hopes of cultivating candidates with similarly mixed views and even changing laws to expand voter participation and encourage a more diverse set of candidates to run. He’s not expecting results anytime soon. The goal is gradual change over years, even decades, to slowly nudge Americans back toward one another. For now, though, he’s stuck in the Trump era. “You can kick a barn down in 15 minutes,” Galen said. “It takes weeks to build a new one.” ', 'http://www.nbcnews.com/specials/mad-about-trump', 'https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/2018/06/leftright-alignment/images/01/cover01.jpg', '2018-09-04 10:38:27', -1, 5),

If May can find the way to take Johnson over it with her, she would not survive. But she would leave with honour, dignity, and the eternal gratitude of a nation', 'In whatever time she has left, Theresa May faces two major challenges. One seems undeliverable: at this moment, you’d have to be on a fairly spectacular acid trip to picture her finessing any Brexit through the Commons or past the country. The other, however, looks more achievable. This PM must ensure that Boris Johnson is not the next. People laughed at Boris when his ambition first became obvious. But as with Bob Monkhouse, helmsman of Family Fortunes long before Stanley Johnson monetised the bloodline on I’m A Celebrity, they’re not laughing now. This is lethally serious. If only there were a recent precedent of a metropolitan elite underestimating a mendacious, egomaniacal chancer with an arrestable offence masquerading as a hairdo? In its absence, we’re on the cusp of a leadership challenge from someone whom a more serious democracy, such as Toytown, wouldn’t entrust with the post of undersecretary of state for cleaning PC Plod’s helmet. How close he is to launching the coup, and how viable it would be, is unclear. So often has “Baby Trump” – I know it sounds like tautology; just think of a toddler cuddling a Tiny Tears doll – knocked on the No 10 door and run away that it’s tempting to dismiss this latest intervention as another round of Knock Down Ginger. This one, confided to readers of his Telegraph musings, seemed deranged even for him, as he delved into professional wrestling for a wicked conspiracy. “The whole thing is about as preordained as a bout between Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy,” he wrote of Brexit. Younger readers may know nothing of those British precursors to Hulk Hogan and The Rock. But, thanks to WWE, they will be familiar with expertly choreographed wrestling bouts with fabricated outcomes. Does that sound like Brexit to you? Does anything here look meticulously rehearsed? Do you discern the hint expert choreography in all the punch drunk staggering across the Brexit ring? There’s method in his madness, of course. Step one, when you’re trying to incite the headbangers’ rage, is to feed the addiction to the sense of betrayal, which is the drug of choice for those at both extremes of the mainstream political spectrum. Whether it’s Corbyn cultists dreaming of deselecting ideological traitors, or Brexit ultras fantasising about the purifying power of the no-deal bonfire, they live for it. Boris knows this. If anything has the flavour of wrestling moves in this waking nightmare, it’s his ritualistic use of the language of surrender to put May in a half nelson from which she cannot wriggle free. Boris isn’t a half Nelson, or a quarter Churchill. Where they rescued their country, he would burn it for power. He’d burn up galaxies for that. But he is a danger, and if and when the leadership challenge comes, it’s a sure thing the threat of deselections will cross the floor of the House. Tory constituencies will come under pressure to ditch MPs who refuse to back the standard bearer of the Brexit far right. If Boris gets into the two candidate runoff against a “moderate” such as Sajid Javid or Jeremy Hunt, he wins. This scenario being at least as mortifying to May as to anyone else on nodding terms with sanity, her last and greatest duty is to stop Boris even at the cost of her own political life. For a vicar’s daughter, the literary reference point is Judges 16:29, in which Samson brought down the temple roof to destroy the Philistines as well as himself. But sticking with wrestling analogies, a more recent episode from western fiction will suffice. I refer to Sherlock Holmes taking out Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls. It is true (spoiler alert) that due to popular demand, Conan Doyle resurrected Holmes. “We tottered together upon the brink of the fall,” he tells Watson in The Empty House. “I have some knowledge of baritsu, or the Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me.” But originally, in The Final Problem, Holmes calculated the cost of his life as a bargain to take Moriarty down with him and save his country from its worst menace. Accepting that delivering a strong and stable Brexit – or any Brexit – is plainly beyond her, May must identify stopping Boris as her final problem. Downing Street statements about his lack of new ideas won’t cut it. It’s long been apparent that he doesn’t have any old ideas. She cannot rely on the common sense or decency of her MPs. The majority know Boris for what he is, and plenty actively hate him. But under duress from local parties, with opinion polls citing him as their best hope of holding their seats, they are capable of sending his name to the members. You need only glance at the cowardice of congressional Republicans to appreciate the career politician’s capacity for indecency. You need merely recall that 15 years ago Tory MPs put Iain Duncan Smith into the final two to gauge their common sense. God knows what May’s solution to the Boris problem might be. It could be timing her departure for maximum impact on his prospects and making a resignation statement itemising her fears in brutal detail. If it came with the risk of doing time under the Official Secrets Act, or worse still losing the automatic peerage, she could declassify his MI5 file. That ought to do it. Whatever it takes, she must know, if she didn’t before, that she and Boris are engaged in a deathly grapple on the edge of a terrifying abyss. If she can find a way to take him over it with her, she wouldn’t come back. But she would leave with honour, dignity, and the eternal gratitude of a nation that would at least be able to know itself as slightly less terminally gullible than the United States.

(179, 'Does Chris Evans'' departure highlight bigger problems at the BBC?', 'Whatever is going on behind closed doors at the broadcaster, something is amiss', 'For the second time in two years, Chris Evans has quit a high profile job at the BBC. The difference is that while his departure from Top Gear after a single disastrous season was regarded as a failure on his part, his decision to leave the Radio 2 breakfast show will be seen by many as a sign of something badly amiss at his employer. BBC Radio was already in trouble before Evans announced on air that he was jumping ship for Virgin Radio’s digital service, where he takes over the same breakfast slot he has occupied on Radio 2 since 2010 (he has promised to stay in his old job until Christmas, so that the BBC can hire a replacement). There was shock in July when Eddie Mair stepped down as presenter of Radio 4’s PM programme. The hard-nosed interviewer has since denied rumours he left because of moves to cut his reported £300,000-£350,000 salary as part of clampdown on gender pay inequality at the broadcaster (he said the decision was borne of “a sort of sense of ennui”). Either way, he was out the door and off to LBC. Also throwing in the towel was Radio 1 breakfast host Nick Grimshaw, who in August stepped away from the highest profile job in British radio as his ratings plunged to a record low (though he hasn’t departed the BBC outright and will host an afternoon slot). Meanwhile, grumbles continue over the awkward parachuting in of Jo Whiley to Simon Mayo’s popular Radio 2 drivetime slot. Against such upheavals, Evans’s announcement will be perceived as another black mark against management at BBC Radio. His listenership was solid, albeit in gentle decline – down from 9.91 million in 2014 to 9.2 million in May – and he was no longer a figure of controversy as in the past. To claim he was on his way to the national treasure status enjoyed by his predecessor Terry Wogan would be an overstatement. But his was not seen as a job up for grabs. Now it will be a job very much up for grabs. Already several potential replacements have been touted. Sara Cox, his regular stand-in, is perceived as having the common touch, while her flinty humour is the perfect morning pick me up. Also in the frame surely is Whiley, whom executives at Radio 2 are clearly keen on, having already bunged her into the afternoon slot, despite the protests of Simon Mayo fans. A left field choice would be Claudia Winkleman, whose Claudia on Sunday show has confirmed her ability to deliver top level chat. And with Strictly still a ratings juggernaut she would bring instant name recognition. Giving her the gig might also arrest the sense of musical chairs within BBC radio, whereby long-in-the-tooth broadcasters are switched between slots without any consideration given to new talent, as Winkleman would be regarded in the context of morning radio. The degree to which his decision stems from the controversy over pay at the BBC is impossible to say. But he will have felt the heat last year as it was announced that he was the highest earner at the corporation with a package worth between £2.2m and £2.49m (it has since come down to £1.66m to £1.669m as a consequence of his quitting Top Gear). Claudia Winkleman was the only woman to feature among the top 10 earners – a fact reported to have provoked as much soul-searching within the BBC as pay levels themselves. At the time Evans said it was right and proper that the pay of top presenters be made public. And because he is regarded as highly bankable talent operating in the commercially competitive market of morning radio, he was one of the few whose wages were not reduced as part of the BBC’s new push to eliminate the gender pay disparity. But while meaningful steps to end the pay imbalance at the corporation are of course long overdue there is a sense that this doesn’t quite explain the air of crisis over BBC Radio. After all, the BBC’s television division has been subject to the same scrutiny – and it has not seen its top names stampeding for the exit. One theory is that BBC Radio is simply feeling the sharp end of the competition posed by the internet. The worry that audiences – and younger ones especially – are abandoning the format is supported by data. Only 22 per cent of those aged 16 to 24 tune into radio regularly, which explains plunging ratings for shows such as Grimshaw’s, which lost 400,000 listeners in the first six months of 2018. The only consolation for Grimshaw is that he isn’t the only one feeling the pressure – in July, overall listenership for Radio 1 fell to the second lowest level ever of 9.2 million, with Heart Radio now drawing a bigger audience. Evans’ numbers are down, too, and overall the figures have been grim at Radio 2, which has lost 500,000 listeners according to the latest data. Even the esteemed Today show on Radio 4 is finding it hard to hold onto its audience, with 65,000 jumping ship in the first quarter of 2018. Such a slump could be written off as part of a wider trend if the BBC’s rivals were also seeing their market shrink but they aren’t. Grimshaw’s predecessor Chris Moyles grew his Radio X breakfast listeners by 100,000 for instance, while Heart radio has surged to a record 9.5 million in the ratings If it isn’t the medium of radio itself, then perhaps it’s the BBC. Carping about the broadcaster is a long-running national pastime yet some of the recent decisions in radio have called into question management culture. There was widespread derision in July when Radio 1 abruptly pulled an interview with controversial YouTuber Logan Paul, with the excuse that the segment wasn’t of sufficient quality to broadcast. The claim was met with incredulity. Radio 1 had been perfectly happy hyping the interview until a public outcry. Why try to fob off listeners with the threadbare pretext that the piece wasn’t good enough when it was plain to everyone that the broadcaster was bowing to the backlash? It was foolhardy in the first place to speak with Paul, a controversial figure since posing on camera last December with the body of a person who had died by suicide. Backing out and then putting forth a flimsy excuse portrayed the corporation in an even poorer light. There was also unhappiness over the addition of Jo Whiley to Simon Mayo’s Radio 2 drivetime show as co-host – against the vocal wishes of Mayo, who described the change as “difficult” and was “upset”. His fans have been upset too, complaining of a lack of chemistry between the two and the fact that BBC took something that was working perfectly well and, in their opinion, ruined it (one listener said their personalities went together like “chocolate and cauliflower”). Whether similar shenanigans explain Evans’ decision is hard to say. One rumour is that, despite his pronouncements to the contrary, he was uneasy about his pay being made public and that executives at the BBC were struggling to meet his demands in new contract negotiations. He says he quit because he wanted to take on new challenges. But is hosting Virgin Radio’s equivalent of North Norfolk Digital – the service is digital only with a comparatively insignificant 430,000 listeners – the act of a man eager to take on the world? Whatever is going on behind closed doors at BBC Radio, the worrying rate at which it is shedding presenters, or making its remaining presenters unhappy, speaks to something amiss. The question many will now be asking is not whether it will lose another big name – but who will that name be?

The startup went on to pass through startupbootcamp and crowdfunded a cute looking chocolate-bar shaped hardware starter kit before expanding into building a hardware agnostic cloud services platform to act as a central hub for data flows. relayr then further honed its focus to the needs of industrial IoT, and its platform — which is now used by around 130 businesses — offers end-to-end middleware combined with device management and IoT analytics, and can operate in the cloud, on-premise or a hybrid of both depending on customers needs. We first covered the Berlin-based startup back in 2014 when it closed a $2.3M seed round. It’s raised $66.8M in total, according to Crunchbase, which includes a $30M Series C round in February led by Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners. relayr did not disclose the investors in its 2014 seed at the time, saying only that they were unnamed U.S. and Switzerland-based investors. But Kleiner Perkins and Munich Re (via its HSB subsidiary which is acquiring relayr now) were named as investors in later rounds, along with Deutsche Telekom . Insurance giants and telcos have a clear strategic interest in IoT — with the technology promising to drive network usage and utility on the telco side, and offering transformative potential for the insurance industry as data streams can be used to monitor equipment performance and predict (and even steer off) costly failures. Munich Re said today that its HSB subsidiary is acquiring 100% of relayr in a deal that values the business at $300M. (It’s not clear if it’s all cash or a mix of cash and stock — we’ve asked). It says the deal will help it “shape opportunities in the fast-growing IoT market”, and is envisaging a joint business model with the combined pair developing not just tech solutions for clients but risk management, data analysis and financial instruments. “IoT is already significantly changing our world and has the potential to disrupt the traditional insurance and reinsurance industry through new business models, services and competitors,” said Torsten Jeworrek, member of Munich Re’s board of management in a statement. “I am truly happy to announce this acquisition, as it supports our strategy to combine our knowledge of risk, data analysis skills and financial strength with the technological expertise of relayr. This is our basis to develop new ideas for tomorrow’s commercial and industrial worlds.” “We are delighted to strengthen our relationship with Munich Re/HSB to push digitalization in commercial and industrial markets and strive for our mission to help commercial and industrial businesses stay relevant,” added relayr CEO, Josef Brunner. “The unique combination of the companies demonstrates the importance to deliver business outcomes to customers and the need to combine first-class technology and its delivery with powerful financial and insurance offerings. This transaction is a great opportunity to build a global category leader.” The pair have been partnered since 2016, when the insurance firm invested in relayr’s Series B, but say they see the acquisition strengthening Munich Re’s financial and insurance offerings while also offering a route to expand relayr’s middleware business via leveraging the insurance group’s large client base. “Back in 2016, HSB invested in relayr in an effort to harness the strategically significant business potential offered by IoT. relayr’s end-to-end IoT solutions for the industrial and commercial sectors are an ideal addition to our Group’s capabilities,” said Greg Barats, president and CEO of HSB, and the person responsible for Munich Re’s IoT strategy, in another supporting statement. “HSB has always focused on insurance and technology… relayr will help us to rapidly implement our global strategy to develop new IoT solutions for our clients. Digital transformation in the industrial and commercial sectors offers opportunities for new services and financial applications.” relayr says it already offers industrial companies which are seeking to digitalise their businesses a “comprehensive range of services” — such as being able to extract and analyse data from machines and equipment to determine when a machine is likely to fail (and it touts cutting costs, increased energy efficiency and product quality improvement as among the benefits its platform offers) — but says the acquisition will allow it to develop its “innovative value stack”, by enabling new revenue models, cost reduction, and “increased effectiveness across industries”. It also sees benefit in sitting under the established Munich Re umbrella — as a way to convince customers it will be a long-term business partner. It adds that it will continue to maintain its current focus on IoT for the industrial sector.

(182, 'Maureen Lipman: Celebrities are sending out mixed messages in #MeToo era by dressing like ''prostitutes''', 'The 72-year-old also defended The Pianist director Roman Polanski', 'Maureen Lipman has criticised female celebrities for dressing like “prostitutes” and “confusing” men in the #MeToo era. While acknowledging the support and encouragement women have received when coming forward with their stories, the veteran British actor said there was a tendency to have a “kneejerk” reaction to allegations. She went on to criticise women for wearing “bondage clothing” and “dressing a bit like a prostitute would have dressed”. Lipman told Radio Times: “Young female pop stars, for example, are saying: ‘It’s my body, and I’m empowered to show it to you.’ But then: ‘Don’t touch it, don’t come near it, don’t flirt with it.’ “And that is a bit of a shame because flirting is some of the best fun you’ve ever had in your life. We’re batting our eyelids and clenching our teeth at the same time. And that is very confusing.” The 72-year-old warned that “we mustn’t wipe out men”, adding that, although women have been brutalised over the centuries, the message #MeToo is projecting is not right. “It’s too all-inclusive, and it smacks to me of the reaction to Jimmy Savile: ‘We messed up big-time, now let’s get every light entertainer and unfashionable comedian or performer, let’s get ‘em for putting a hand on a knee 40 years ago.” Lipman went on to defend Roman Polanski who she worked with on the movie The Pianist, calling the director’s decades-long exile from Hollywood “probably enough” punishment. Polanski was initially arrested and charged with raping 13-year-old Samantha Geimer in 1977. “We’ve got to stop judging everybody now on the mores of then,” she said, adding that in the Seventies “it was plausible for a young girl to be brought to Jack Nicholson’s house and left with Roman Polanski. It wasn’t an unusual thing.” Lipman also defended Woody Allen, saying that only reason not to work with the controversial director would be because he does not make good films. “[But] who wouldn’t work with him if he’s going to redo Hannah and Her Sisters?” The actor, who has also been a widely outspoken critic of the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, recently joined the cast of Coronation Street. Although she appeared in the show once before, Lipman will be playing a new character named Evelyn Plummer.

(183, 'Mystery surrounds space station leak after reports hole in outside could have been made by a person', 'Puncture could have been made on purpose, either in space or on Earth, says Roscosmos boss', 'Mystery continues to swirl around a hole found in the outside of the International Space Station. Last week, Nasa and the Russian space agency scrambled to fix a leak in the floating laboratory that was causing air to slowly rush out of the space station. The crew on board eventually plugged up the gap with epoxy, fixing the problem at least temporarily. Initially, astronauts and other experts had suggested that the hole had been caused a by tiny rock that would have hit the space station and ripped a hole in it. "This leak seems to have resulted from a micrometeoroid impact," tweeted ISS veteran Scott Kelly in one representative tweet. But strange reports are now emerging that suggest the leak could actually have been caused by a human. Russian reports citing anonymous sources suggest that the problem could have existed from the time the Soyuz capsule headed up to the International Space Station, and might have been treated with a temporary fix that has recently come undone. Nasa has only said that the Russian space agency has "has convened a commission to conduct further analysis of the possible cause of the leak". Russian news agency TASS reported that the boss of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, said the theory that the hole was caused by an impact had been discounted. "We are considering all the theories," Dmitry Rogozin, according to TASS. "The one about a meteorite impact has been rejected because the spaceship’s hull was evidently impacted from inside. However it is too early to say definitely what happened. "But, it seems to be done by a faltering hand… it is a technological error by a specialist. It was done by a human hand - there are traces of a drill sliding along the surface. We don’t reject any theories." He said that problem could have happened by accident or on purpose, and either on Earth or in space. A full investigation is being mounted to find the person responsible, TASS reported him as saying. Both Nasa and Roscosmos stressed throughout the leak that the astronauts were in no immediate danger, and had been allowed to continue sleeping once the drop in pressure was recognised. Once they were awake, astronauts worked with experts on the ground to find the hole and then to plug it up – initially, simply by placing a finger over the hole. Once it was fixed, pressure appears to have stabilised and the astronauts on board have gone back to their usual schedule. The leak was traced back to the orbital part of the Soyuz capsule, which docked on the side of the International Space Station when it arrived. It is that capsule that astronauts are set to use to come back down to Earth, and work is ongoing to ensure the rest of the craft is safe.

The blonde beauty, who was discovered in Missouri at age 14 at a bar mitzvah party for her striking features and towering height, told Fox News cover girl hopefuls need to look past the glossy issues and realize it takes more than a pretty face to survive the industry. Thrilled to share my new @moroccanoil campaign with you guys !!!! So happy I could be a part of this! And thank you for the better, blonder, healthier hair! ????????‍♀️???? A post shared by  devon windsor (@devwindsor) on Apr 25, 2018 at 5:33am PDT “You definitely have to grow that thick skin because otherwise you’ll just get chewed up and spit out,” warned Windsor. “It’s a harsh world out there.” Windsor – who didn’t pursue modeling full time until age 18, after she finished school – has become one of the most sought-after faces in the industry. She has appeared in over 20 international collections, including Prada and Christian Dior. She has also walked the runway for countless couture brands, including Chanel and Balmain, among others. Her famous figure has also appeared on the pages of Maxim and Vogue Germany, just to name a few. A post shared by  devon windsor (@devwindsor) on Nov 20, 2017 at 11:15am PST However, Windsor is best recognized for being a regular in the annual Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show since 2014. While the brand is known for its racy lingerie, Windsor insisted she’s received plenty of support from her family to participate in the televised show. She insisted it’s the secret behind her lasting success. “I’ve been lucky enough to be surrounded by people that were always supporting me, and I never felt pressure,” she explained. “I’ve always been comfortable and confident in my own body, and I see wearing lingerie kind of like wearing a bikini. A post shared by  devon windsor (@devwindsor) on Nov 20, 2017 at 3:05am PST "Obviously, it’s different, but at the time you’re showing the same amount. My bikinis are very skimpy, so maybe not for everyone… Not everyone’s going to love you or what you do. Someone’s always going to complain about something.” The St. Louis native admitted that being a top model is far from simply striking a pose. In addition to constantly working out to stay in camera-ready shape all year long and making sure your features are flawless, there’s also the overwhelming scrutiny from both the public, as well as those doing the hiring. “The biggest challenge for me, and I think for most girls, is just the criticism, the amount of criticism that we take, honestly, every day,” said Windsor. “We’re being critiqued every day, whether you hear them critiquing you or it’s behind your back, whether it’s the client, casting, friends, agents — you’re constantly being judged and you’re constantly being denied. MAXIM COVER STORY OUT NOW!! ⚡️⚡️ . Thank you so much, such an honor to be your October cover star!! A post shared by  devon windsor (@devwindsor) on Sep 15, 2017 at 5:58am PDT “We’re denied more opportunities than we get… Dealing with that rejection has definitely been difficult for me… But I learned to just get over it and realize that it’s not personal… It can also just be exhausting, and you’re lonely. All of that comes with the territory, but the rejection is something that stabs you every time.” Windsor acknowledged that modeling offers plenty of perks, including getaways to some of the most beautiful and exclusive locations in the world, plenty of couture, as well as non-stop invites to celebrity hot spots and parties. However, models will get heavily scrutinized frequently whether they like it or not. ✨✨✨✨✨✨ . Currently flying back home right now and honestly cannot stop smiling. This year has been a crazy one for me with lots of ups and downs but being able to walk in this show really makes everything worth it! There’s no better way to wrap up 2017! I am beyond grateful and humbled for this experience. Thank you Sophia, Ed, Monica and John for being the first people who saw that this small town girl had the potential to walk that runway! You make dreams into reality for so many girls.  I am so proud to say that I have been fortunate enough to work with you guys for the fifth time in a row! I wouldn’t trade this for anything in the world. I know how complicated it is to put a show of this size together but all that hard work paid off...Cheers to the greatest show on earth! ???? A post shared by  devon windsor (@devwindsor) on Nov 21, 2017 at 11:00am PST “We get put down a lot in this industry, and I think when you’re really young and you’re not used to it, it really hurts you,” she said. “Because a lot of girls become depressed or anxious and they just can’t handle the rejection. They take it very personally. And I think as you get older, as you become more comfortable in this industry, that you understand it’s not really about just you. There are so many factors involved in picking a model for a shoot or show. If they want a brunette then they’re not going to go with me.” Windsor recalled being sent straight to Milan alone and far away from her family in Missouri after she graduated from high school to work — an experience she described as “really hard” to cope. A post shared by  devon windsor (@devwindsor) on Apr 14, 2018 at 2:31pm PDT But there was one thing that comforted Windsor — country music. “Personally, I grew up around it,” she said. “I’ve had a ranch house my whole life, so we’d go down there, be in nature and just listen to country music. For me, it’s very relaxing. When I hear it while I’m traveling or wherever I am, even working, it just mellows me out and brings me back home… It’s comforting.” And her perseverance paid off. In 2014, Windsor got the call that she was going to appear in Victoria’s Secret for the very first time. In honor of castings this week I figured I would throw up this magical moment !!! #VSFashionShow ✨✨ A post shared by  devon windsor (@devwindsor) on Aug 18, 2017 at 7:01am PDT “It was absolutely insane,” said Windsor about landing the heavenly gig. “I was shopping and… screamed on the phone… I remember calling my mom and she was crying. She couldn’t believe it. And neither could I honestly. I never thought I would get it.” Windsor hopes her participation in “Model Squad” will show other young girls the little-known, less glamorous side to modeling. It takes plenty of hard work and guts to make it successfully — but it can be done. “I wanted to show people what it was really like to be in this industry,” she said. “Because they only really see one side, whether it’s social media or wherever, they only see that glamorous side, the life that we live, and there’s so much more to it.” Missing backstage moments like these with the geeeegs A post shared by  devon windsor (@devwindsor) on Dec 10, 2016 at 8:04am PST "Model Squad" airs premieres Tuesday, Sept. 4 at 8 p.m. on E!

The 70-metre long structure has attracted 149 "excellent" reviews describing it as the town''s "crowning jewel" and "a modern Taj Mahal" that warrants a place as one of the seven wonders of the world. Other visitors have praised its "handcrafted Cornish Perspex", its panoramic views, and its proximity to shops, parking and a cash machine. "On visiting Bude this summer we must have picked the only rainy day so we popped in to the supermarket picked up some pasties got our holding chairs out of the car and set up a picnic in the tunnel and at one point the sun came out and created a wonderful rainbow though the roof," said one reviewer who gave it the top rating. It has even been described as a "great place for a divorce" by a user known only as Anne, who wrote: "The walk back through the elongated tunnel felt like the first step towards freedom from Steven and his massive collection of recorders." The tunnel is now ranked above the coastal walk, Bude Sea Pool, public beaches and surfing. Many visitors have posted photos of their visits to the passageway since its status as a tourist attraction has become better known. Postcards featuring the Bude Tunnel are also on sale for 50p from a local cafe. The tunnel''s profile on TripAdvisor as a "thing to do" claims that "nowhere else in Bude can you walk this far undercover in a continuous straight line". It received its first rating in September 2017, which revelled in the way it allows shoppers to stroll between the Sainsbury''s supermarket and the car park on Crooklet Road while enjoying complete protection from inclement Cornish weather. Awarding it an "excellent" ranking, the user wrote: "It was also quite fun to watch from inside as the rain pelted down on people trying to pack their shopping in to their cars as quickly as possible while me and my family were nice and dry. And having a right laugh!" Despite the bountiful opportunities it evidently affords for schadenfreude, not everyone who has wandered beneath its arches has fallen under the tunnel''s spell. The second reviewer awarded it an "average" rating, adding: "The tunnel is useful for one thing - to keep dry if it is raining. Never in a million years would I have called this architecture, and certainly not an attraction." Six other people subsequently took time to log on and document their immunity to the tunnel''s charms, condemning it as "terrible".

Jira Ops integrates with tools like OpsGenie, PagerDuty, xMatters, Statuspage, Slack and others. Many teams already use these tools when their services go down, but Atlassian argues that most companies currently use a rather ad hoc approach to working with them. Jira Ops aims to be the glue that keeps everybody on the same page and provides visibility into ongoing incidents. This is obviously not the first time Atlassian  is using Jira to branch out from its core developer audience. Jira Service Desk and Jira Core, for example, aim at a far broader audience. Ops, however, goes after a very specific vertical. “Service Desk was the first step,” Jens Schumacher, Head of Software Teams at Atlassian, told me. And we were looking at what are the other verticals that we can attack with Jira.” Schumacher also noted that Atlassian built a lot of tools for its internal ops teams over the years to glue together all the different pieces that are necessary to track and manage incidents. With Jira Ops, the company is essentially turning its own playbook into a product. In a way, though, using Jira Ops adds yet another piece to the puzzle. Schumacher, however, argues that the idea here is to have a single place to manage the process. “The is that when an incident happens, you have a central place where you can go, where you can find out everything about the incident,” he said. “You can see who has been paged and alerted; you can alert more people if you need to right from there; you know what Slack channel the incident is being discussed in.” Unlike some of Atlassian’s other products, the company doesn’t currently have any plans to launch a self-hosted version of Jira Ops. The argument here is pretty straightforward: if your infrastructure goes down, then Jira Opes could also go do down — and then you don’t have a tool for managing that downtime. Jira Ops is now available for free for early access beta users. The company expects to launch version 1.0 in early 2019. By then Atlassian will surely also have figured out a pricing plan, something it didn’t announce today.

The round is led by European growth capital investor 3TS Capital Partners, alongside PortfoLion, a Central European venture capital. A number of existing investors also participated, such as Andreas Kemi, an early investor in LogMeIn and co-founder of Scala Business Solutions, and Márton Anka, founder of LogMeIn. I also understand the round included some secondary funding, meaning not all of the cash has entered Tresorit’s  balance sheet. Operating in the enterprise cloud storage and collaboration market, Tresorit provides what it describes as zero-knowledge encryption technology and unique encryption key management. The high level pitch is that the company is able to offer on-premise equivalent security for businesses while offering the type of simple user experience we have come to expect in consumer apps. It serves more than 17,000 customers and says it has grown recurring revenue by an average of 3x every year in the last three years. Meanwhile, Tresorit will use the new Series B funding to further accelerate this growth by tapping into what it says is rising demand for secure cloud solutions, in light of a plethora of high profiles security breaches seen at major enterprises in recent years. This will include beefing up its management team with the aim of scaling up marketing and sales, and establishing new channel partners. “We are at an inflection point with our business as awareness regarding data protection and cybersecurity threats is getting stronger and demand is set to grow exponentially for our service in and outside of Europe,” says Tresorit founder and CEO Istvan Lam. He also says there is large market potential in channeling traditional IT expenditure into the cloud, citing a recent Deloitte survey indicating that traditional IT expenditure still accounts for two-thirds of all IT spending, while only one-third goes towards IT-as-a-service. “Many enterprises are holding back from migrating to the cloud due to security and privacy concerns. With security guaranteed by end-to-end encryption, more businesses can and will choose Tresorit’s cloud solution,” adds Lam. To that end, Tresorit recently launched a Beta version of “Tresorit Send,” a standalone file sharing product that offers a secure and encrypted alternative to unreliable file transfer sites and email attachments. The idea, presumably, is for the product to act as a shop window for the Tresorit user experience and the company’s broader end-to-end encryption offering.

(188, 'Three reasons why Kavanaugh deserves a seat on the Supreme Court', 'When the Senate Judiciary Committee begins its confirmation hearing Tuesday on Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court we can expect to see Democrats wage an all-out battle to keep the extraordinarily qualified judge off the nation’s high…', 'Gorsuch communications strategist talks Kavanaugh confirmation hearing and provides an inside look at the preparations. Hillary Shelton of the NAACP declared that Kavanaugh is a “dangerous criminal.” Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., warned that Kavanaugh “wants to pave the path to tyranny.” Sen. Cory Booker, D-N. J., called the judge’s nomination “alarming.” This wildly inaccurate and hysterical rhetoric is little more than political grandstanding. “I don’t think any Democrat is going to go along with a Trump appointee to the Supreme Court,” said Democratic strategist Paul Begala. “Not if he or she wants to raise any money or have any volunteers.” Notwithstanding the partisan pressure to grandstand, it is unconscionable to demonize this father of two who serves meals at Catholic charities and tutors at a local elementary school. Kavanaugh is eminently qualified when we evaluate him on his legal credentials, judicial philosophy and personal character. These are the three criteria by which Americans have traditionally assessed Supreme Court nominees. First, Kavanaugh’s legal credentials are impeccable. Kavanaugh earned his law degree from Yale University and was a law clerk for recently retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose seat he will fill if confirmed. The Supreme Court nominee was an attorney on the staff of Independent Counsel Ken Starr and played a key role in writing the report that called for impeaching President Clinton. He worked in the White House Counsel’s Office and was later White House staff secretary for President George W. Bush. He was a partner in a law firm. He has served on the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington since 2006. Within days of his nomination to the Supreme Court in July by President Trump, statements of support came pouring in from lawyers and others around the country describing Kavanaugh as impeccably qualified. As Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has made clear, the bizarre request by Democrats for millions of pages of presidential documents from Kavanaugh’s tenure in the White House proves that Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are desperate. Second, Kavanaugh’s judicial philosophy is faithful to the Founding Father’s vision. As numerous legal scholars have noted, Kavanaugh’s legal opinions and occasional writings coalesce to provide a clear picture of his judicial philosophy, especially his view that a judge’s role is to be an “umpire” rather than a “player.” As Chief Justice John Roberts once put it: “Judges are like umpires. Umpires don’t make the rules; they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules. But it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire.” This aspect of Kavanaugh’s judicial philosophy is so important because, sadly, in recent years many federal judges have embraced a “living document” view of the Constitution. This progressive view encourages judges to view themselves as players rather than umpires. The “living document” view contends that judges have the right to reinterpret the Constitution in light of “the times.” Its overall effect is that a Supreme Court majority can remove things from the Constitution that justices do not like and insert things they do. The “living document” view enabled the Supreme Court to issue its Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 legalizing abortion nationwide and its Obergefell v. Hodges decision in 2015 that said same-sex couples have the right to marry. In response to the “living document” view, the conservative view is that members of the Supreme Court do not have the right to revise the Constitution. Although the Constitution may need to be revised from time to time, America’s Founding Fathers made clear that an amendment to the Constitution must reflect the will of the people. An amendment requires an overwhelming congressional majority and ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures. Kavanaugh – like Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia before him – rejects the “living document” view. He would refrain from the type of judicial activism that bypasses the American people. Third, Kavanaugh’s personal character meets the high standard necessary for serving on the high court. Any number of character attributes are desirable in Supreme Court justices. We want them to be conscientious because we know that it takes hard work and perseverance to adjudicate complex legal issues. Similarly, we want our justices to be wise and discerning rather than simplistic or superficial. Perhaps most importantly, we want our justices to be trustworthy, to be the type of people who can’t be “bought off” by corporations or unduly influenced by partisan politicians. By all serious accounts, Kavanaugh is just such a person. In Washington, Kavanaugh is known not only for his legal prowess, but also for serving meals to the homeless and tutoring underprivileged children. He has received vigorous bipartisan support from more than 160 members of the Yale community, who wrote that Kavanaugh “is a person of deep conviction and integrity.” Kavanaugh has even garnered support from prominent liberals such as Lisa Blatt, a feminist lawyer who worked in the Clinton and Obama administrations but declared that Kavanaugh is “supremely qualified.” In light of Kavanaugh’s impeccable legal credentials, judicial philosophy, and personal character – along with the robust bipartisan support he’s received from legal experts around the nation – let’s hope that good-thinking Democratic senators such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia will find a way to extricate themselves from the grandstanding so prevalent in their party and support Kavanaugh’s nomination. Any Democrat who votes to confirm Kavanaugh will have an opportunity to eschew partisan grandstanding and send a message to the nation that Supreme Court justices should be evaluated on their merits.

The eulogist, the Rev. Jasper Williams Jr., was criticized for a political address at the Friday funeral that described children being in a home without a father as "abortion after birth" and said black lives do not matter unless blacks stop killing each other. "He spoke for 50 minutes and at no time did he properly eulogize her," said Vaughn Franklin, the late singer''s nephew, who said he was delivering a statement for the family. Franklin said that his aunt never asked Williams to eulogize her, since she didn''t talk about plans for her own funeral. The family selected Williams because he has spoken at other family memorials in the past, most prominently at the funeral for Franklin''s father, minister and civil rights activist C.L. Franklin, 34 years ago. Williams has not backed down from anything he said at the funeral, and said he respects the family''s opinion. "I understand it," he said. "I regret it. But I''m sorry they feel that way." Besides a social media uproar, Williams heard resistance at the funeral itself. Singer Stevie Wonder yelled out "black lives matter" after the pastor said, "No, black lives do not matter" during his eulogy. Williams had minimized the Black Lives Matter movement because of black-on-black crime. "Black lives must not matter until black people start respecting black lives and stop killing ourselves." He also said "there are not fathers in the home no more" and said that a black woman cannot raise a black boy to be a man.

The company, which submitted a prospectus under the name Entertainment Plus, didn’t say when the IPO will be or valuation details, but reports earlier this year said Maoyan aims to raise up to $1 billion. The timing of Maoyan’s  IPO is noteworthy because it comes as another Tencent investment, Meituan-Dianping, is preparing for its own debut (Meituan is also one of Maoyan’s investors). Both Meituan and Maoyan are key chess pieces in Tencent’s online-to-offline services rivalry with Alibaba. Meituan holds the leading market share for online services in China by market volume, though Alibaba wants to challenge that with Ele.me and Kuobei, which it recently raised $3 billion for after consolidating the two into one holding company. Likewise, Maoyan is the largest online movie ticketing app service in China, but is up against Alibaba’s Tao Piao Piao. Last November, Maoyan raised RMB 1 billion (about $150 million) from Tencent at a RMB 20 billion valuation, a couple of months after merging with Weiying, another ticketing service backed by Tencent. In addition to Tencent and Meituan, Maoyan’s investors include Beijing-based Enlight Media. It also co-finances and distributes movies in China, such as Paramount’s “Transformers: The Last Knight.” Both Maoyan and Tao Piao Piao are fighting for domination of what is set to become the world’s biggest market for movies. In its prospectus, Maoyan cited findings from iResearch that show China’s entertainment market is currently second only to the United States, but is expected to become larger by 2019. It reached a market size of RMB 76.1 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 20.7% to RMB 194.5 billion by 2022. Maoyan says its revenue grew to RMB 2.54 billion in 2017 from RMB 596.7 million in 2015, with a CAGR of 106.6%. In the first half of this year, it recorded revenue of RMB 1.9 billion and a net loss of RMB 231 million. Maoyan says it held market share of 60.9% by gross merchandise volume in the first half of 2018, according to iResearch.

The company is building an alternative to traditional bank accounts for freelancers working in France. XAnge is leading today’s round with existing investor Daphni also participating, as well as business angels Gilles Samoun and Ed Zimmerman. The company previously raised $3.3 million (€2.8 million) from Daphni, Kima Ventures and various business angels. While it’s pretty easy to get started as a freelancer in many countries, France is not one of them. You need to register a “micro-company”, report your earnings for corporate taxes, report sales tax collection in some cases and more. Arguably, it has gotten much easier recently with a ton of resources to get started. But Shine  wants to go one step further and package everything you need in an app. Shine starts by helping you register your company. After downloading the app, the company will guide you through the process — you need to take a photo of your ID and fill out a form. It feels like signing up to a social network. Compared to the official process, Shine’s process is less intimidating and easier to understand. You can send and receive money from your Shine account just like in any banking app. Shine gives you your own banking information (IBAN) to receive payments and pay using direct debit. A few days later, you receive a debit card. You can temporarily lock the card or disable some features in the app, such as ATM withdrawals and online payments. Shine doesn’t handle IBAN and cards directly. The company partners with Treezor for those banking features. If you’re a rider on Deliveroo and UberEats, or if you work with a freelancer marketplace, such as Malt, Side, Upwork and Brigad, all you need to do is enter your Shine IBAN on those platforms. If you work with clients directly, Shine has an integrated invoicing system. It generates a web page and a PDF that you can send to your clients. When a client opens the page, you get a notification. They can pay with a card. Finally, Shine reminds you when you have to pay your taxes and has a customer support team that can help you figure out what you need to do. They’re slowly building a comprehensive knowledge base on being a freelancer in France. Shine is free for everything I just described except if you choose to accept card payments on your invoices. But even for that feature, it remains quite cheap. The company plans to launch a premium plan in the coming months with advanced accounting features. So far, 25,000 freelancers are using Shine in France. And 10 percent of new freelancers (“micro-entrepreneurs”) register their company through Shine. While challenger banks, such as N26 and Revolut are widely successful, it’s great to see some companies focus on niche markets with the same approach. Shine is a breath of fresh air for freelancers in France. The company is making the process so much easier for newcomers.

The FBI investigation into whether out-of-town developers were able to influence city development projects has already become fodder for political attacks against the gubernatorial candidate, who won the state''s Democratic primary last week and rose to national prominence because of his historic win and gripping personal story. "He is embroiled in a lot of corruption scandals," Rep. Ron DeSantis, Gillum''s Republican opponent, said on Fox News after the primary win. "This guy can''t even run the city of Tallahassee. There is no way Florida voters can entrust him with our entire state." Gillum''s level of exposure in the probe remains unclear, though the mayor has long said publicly that the FBI told him he was not a focus of the investigation. His campaign officials have said the same thing and looked to turn the attack back on DeSantis. "Mayor Gillum is not a subject of the FBI investigation, and he''s committed to rooting out any corruption or wrongdoing in Tallahassee," said Geoff Burgan, Gillum''s spokesman. "We''re not going to take ethics lectures from Congressman Ron DeSantis, who is marching in lockstep with the most morally, ethically and legally challenged President in American history." Gillum has not been named in any of the subpoenas, but questions have been raised about his potential involvement, in part because the investigators have compelled information from Adam Corey, a lobbyist and longtime Gillum friend who volunteered as finance chair on his 2014 mayoral campaign. Hundreds of Corey''s emails have been posted online, at Gillum''s direction, fodder for Republican groups that will spend millions looking to stop Gillum''s campaign. Gillum''s ties to Corey, whom he met while he was in college, have long raised questions. The Tallahassee Democrat reported in 2015 that Gillum''s 2013 decision as a city commissioner to vote to fund a multimillion-dollar project tied to Corey through the city''s community redevelopment agency raised questions because of their friendship, even though city lawyers deemed Gillum did not have a conflict of interest. The vote made way for Corey and other partners to convert a turn-of-the-century electric plant into an upmarket restaurant named Edison. Those questions grew when the paper reported on Gillum and Corey vacationing together in Costa Rica, where they agreed to meet with Mike Miller, a name used by one of three FBI agents posing as developers, once they were back in Florida. Gillum''s chief of staff told the paper that the trip was not business related and that he was on vacation with friends. Questions have also been raised about a 2016 trip to New York, where Corey and Miller were also present. A local television station published a photo in August of 2017 that showed Corey, Gillum and an FBI agent sitting in the back of a boat in New York harbor with the Statue of Liberty in the background. According to public documents, the undercover agents posing as developers got close to city officials and lobbyists in an attempt to snuff out public corruption. FBI agents subpoenaed thousands of records in June 2017 and Gillum''s office then posted those records online. Reporting from the Tallahassee Democrat found that a cadre of city officials and power brokers have been named in the subpoenas, but Gillum''s campaign has denied any connection to the probe and pledged to work with the FBI. Even so, Republicans will seek to use the investigation to bludgeon Gillum''s campaign. The Republican Governors Association has already put out a digital ad on the probe and Jon Thompson, a spokesman for the group, told CNN that is likely just the beginning. "This FBI investigation will haunt Andrew Gillum''s gubernatorial campaign and will be a very lethal attack," he said. Jared Leopold, spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, responded, "Ron DeSantis has spent his political career pandering to far-right fringe elements, by voting to raise the retirement age and jack up health care costs on Floridians with pre-existing conditions. The RGA is desperate to rewrite history now that they''re saddled with a candidate who is more extreme than Trump." The Gillum-DeSantis race is likely to be one of the most expensive gubernatorial contests in the country, with both campaigns and outside groups spending millions to control Florida''s executive branch. Gillum has sought to fight back on the attacks by distancing himself from Corey and pledging to be helpful, while also using his approach to the investigation to attack President Donald Trump, a vocal DeSantis backer. "We want to make sure that any individual that participated in that is held fully accountable. The good news is, is that it doesn''t involve my government or myself. We have all been fully cooperating," Gillum told CNN''s Dana Bash in an interview Sunday on "State of the Union." Despite their longtime friendship, Gillum also distanced himself from Corey by referring to him as just a campaign volunteer. Referring to Trump''s constant attacks against the FBI for the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Gillum added, "The difference between how we have addressed this and how Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump have addressed the FBI is that we have welcomed them and have tried to aid in their work." No charges have been filed to date as a result of the Tallahassee probe.

(196, 'What to watch for at the Kavanaugh hearings', 'Judge Brett Kavanaugh''s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week offers senators their only real opportunity to challenge the Supreme Court nominee''s legal thinking before he would take a lifetime appointment on America''s highest court.', 'Washington (CNN)Judge Brett Kavanaugh''s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week offers senators their only real opportunity to challenge the Supreme Court nominee''s legal thinking before he would take a lifetime appointment on America''s highest court. This time around, the stakes are higher because President Donald Trump''s nominee is poised to succeed swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, the conservative-centrist who joined with liberals to uphold Roe v. Wade and abortion rights. Kennedy was also the decisive vote for same-sex marriage and university affirmative action. But if past confirmation hearings are any lesson, Kavanaugh, previously a top aide to President George W. Bush, will try to reveal as little as possible while being as pleasant as possible. Special counsel Robert Mueller''s investigation into Russia''s interference in the 2016 presidential election remains at the forefront of the political arena, and this will be no exception. The Supreme Court could ultimately resolve disputes arising from that investigation, and senators have said they will ask Kavanaugh about his views of executive power and when the president can be subject to investigation and indictment. Kavanaugh knows a thing or two about investigating a president. He worked as a deputy to independent counsel Ken Starr, going after President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Back then, in a memo, he explained why he felt it was necessary to get Clinton to answer questions under oath about White House intern Monica Lewinsky. In the memo, he suggested that the American people and Congress needed to know the full extent of the President''s wrongdoing. But after serving in the Bush White House, his thinking about pursuing a president seems to have evolved. In 2009, he wrote that having seen how "complex" and "difficult" the job was, he thought it was "vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible." He proposed that any criminal or civil claims against a president be deferred until he left office. "(T)he indictment and trial of a sitting president," Kavanaugh wrote in a 2009 law review, "would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas." For Democrats, health care is a possible way to win political points for the upcoming midterm elections at the hearings. Democrats have said they worry that Kavanaugh would move to strike down popular provisions, such as the requirement that insurers cover everyone regardless of medical history and do not charge more for people with certain health conditions. "I think this becomes the narrative of his nomination, which could bring it down," said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, according to the Los Angeles Times. "If people realize that their insurance is at risk because of this court nominee, I think there is going to be a lot of pressure put on a lot of people to vote no." Trump has long criticized the 2010 Affordable Care Act and targeted Chief Justice John Roberts for his crucial fifth vote to uphold the law in 2012. "If I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush''s appointee John Roberts on Obamacare," Trump tweeted in 2015. When a DC Circuit panel upheld the ACA in 2011, Kavanaugh dissented on procedural grounds, rather than assessing the merits. He said it was premature to resolve a dispute that involved an insurance mandate to be imposed in 2014, with a tax penalty the following year. Yet as he dissented, Kavanaugh laid out limits on Congress'' power to regulate commerce. The crux of the litigation at that point was whether Congress could order people to buy a product, that is, health insurance. The Trump administration has vigorously worked to eliminate regulations on business, for example, in the workplace and over the environment. White House Counsel Don McGahn has said the administration has screened judicial candidates for an anti-regulatory focus. Kavanaugh''s thinking has been in sync with the administration. He has argued that regulatory agencies should exercise authority only when it is clearly spelled out in federal statutes, departing from the judicial practice of deferring to agency interpretations of an open-ended law. In one 2014 dispute, Kavanaugh criticized a Labor Department move to sanction SeaWorld following the drowning of a trainer by the orca Tilikum, declaring that the agency had "stormed headlong into a new regulatory arena." More broadly, Kavanaugh has questioned an entrenched 1984 Supreme Court case, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, that says judges should defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous laws. That, Kavanaugh said in a 2017 speech, "encourages agency aggressiveness on a large scale." Senators will ask Kavanaugh the same question that has come up in almost every modern-day confirmation hearing: Does he think Roe v. Wade, the 1973 opinion that legalized abortion, was wrongly decided and should be overturned? The opinion is more than 40 years old, but it is still a flashpoint and opponents of abortion believe that Kavanaugh will deliver a fifth vote to either overturn Roe or cripple it. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who supports abortion rights, met with Kavanaugh last month and seemed satisfied that he will respect Roe. She said he''d called it "settled law" during their meeting. But while lower court judges must abide by Supreme Court precedent, a Supreme Court justice has the latitude to try to reverse it. Supporters of abortion rights fear the worst, and Democratic senators will push him on the issue. "It''s not enough for Brett Kavanaugh to say that Roe is ''settled law,'' " Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said in a tweet after Collins'' comments. "Chief Justice Roberts said the same thing in 2005. Then he voted in favor of a law that would have forced 75% of Texas clinics to close. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me." Friday evening, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley was informed that the White House would withhold some 100,000 documents concerning Kavanaugh''s record because administration lawyers believe the documents are covered by constitutional privilege. The disclosure infuriated Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, who called it the "Friday Night Document Massacre." "President Trump''s decision to step in at the last moment and hide 100,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh''s records from the American public is not only unprecedented in the history of Supreme Court nominations, it has all the makings of a cover-up," he said. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, is refusing to supply records from Kavanaugh''s years as Bush''s staff secretary. On top of that, there are some documents that lawyers for Trump and the White House have  labeled "committee confidential." Democrats say Grassley has deviated from the normal protocols concerning document delivery. Grassley''s office responds that he''s made hundreds of thousands of documents available, and that Kavanaugh has issued more than 300 opinions that offer the best view of his jurisprudence. Judge Kozinski, who resigned after sexual harassment allegations Kavanaugh was a law clerk to Judge Alex Kozinski from 1991 to 1992 and has remained close to his former boss through the years. When Kavanaugh was nominated to the DC Circuit, Kozinski testified on his behalf at 2006 hearings, and Kavanaugh returned the praise and thanked him for helping his career. Kozinski, who had sat on the California-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals since 1985, stepped down in December after numerous women accused him of sexual harassment. The federal judiciary dropped its investigation of Kozinski once he resigned. As part of that episode, the Senate panel already has scrutinized the judiciary''s misconduct policies, and Democrats are likely to ask what Kavanaugh knew of Kozinski''s behavior as they raise broader sexual-harassment concerns. The White House issued a statement in July saying that Kavanaugh was never aware of allegations of sexual misconduct against his longtime mentor: "Judge Kavanaugh clerked for Alex Kozinski more than 25 years ago. Prior to the public reports late last year, Judge Kavanaugh had never heard any allegations of sexual misconduct or sexual harassment by Judge Kozinski." During several hearings for lower court judges, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, has asked nominees whether they believe that the landmark civil rights opinion Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down the "separate but equal" doctrine in public schools, was correctly decided. Wendy Vitter, a general counsel for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans who was nominated to a district court, said she didn''t mean to be "coy" but that she thought it inappropriate to comment on Supreme Court decisions, "which are correctly decided and which I may disagree with." Her comments triggered outrage. Kavanaugh knows this question is likely coming, and there''s nothing in his record to suggest he would question the validity of Brown. When Roberts was asked this in 2005, he said: "The genius of the decision was the recognition that the act of separating students was where the violation was. And it rejected the defense -- certainly just a theoretical one given the actual record -- that you could have equal facilities and equal treatment." Justice Antonin Scalia, for his part, way back in 1986, wouldn''t even answer whether Marbury v. Madison, the 1803 opinion that asserted the power of judicial review, had been correctly decided. "I don''t think I should answer questions regarding any specific Supreme Court opinion, even one as fundamental as Marbury v. Madison," Scalia said. But he told senators he "ought to be in trouble" if they were to uncover anything he''d written disregarding the opinion, "without you asking me specifically about my views." Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, is ready to pounce on Kavanaugh, because the senator believes that 12 years ago, when Kavanaugh appeared before the Judiciary Committee as a nominee for a powerful appeals court, his testimony was misleading when it came to issues stemming from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. At the time Kavanaugh said, "I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants." Once he was confirmed, however, a Washington Post story recounted how Kavanaugh had participated in a meeting at the White House concerning whether enemy combatants should have access to lawyers. Durbin shot off an angry letter to the judge and said he''d been misled. But supporters of Kavanaugh say that while he may have participated in discussions regarding whether detainees should have the ability to consult with lawyers, he never participated in broader issues related to detainee treatment. Kavanaugh''s White House boss at the time, Alberto Gonzales, said in a recent statement that only a "limited number of personnel" were read into the sensitive legal issues surrounding the authorization of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques on high value detainees. Back in 1999, Kavanaugh said the landmark opinion that ordered President Richard Nixon to turn over White House recordings toward the end of the Watergate investigation might have been "wrongly decided." The comments, made as part of an interview in Washington Lawyer magazine, were included in the thousands of pages of documents released by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The White House was quick to point to a more recent speech in which Kavanaugh praised the 1974 ruling, which rejected Nixon''s claim of executive privilege to withhold the tapes. It was unclear if Kavanaugh had had a change of heart. But in the age of Trump, whose 2016 campaign is under investigation, Democrats are sure to seek clarification from Kavanaugh. John Dean, Nixon''s former White House counsel, is scheduled to testify Friday. Another topic from Kavanaugh''s time with Starr would be his role as a co-author of the 1998 report that laid out grounds for Clinton''s impeachment along with explicit details of sexual encounters between Clinton and Lewinsky. Kavanaugh also proposed hard-hitting, sexually charged questions as the Starr team was preparing to interview Clinton before a grand jury. "The President has disgraced his Office, the legal system, and the American people by having sex with a 22-year-old intern and turning her life into a shambles -- callous and disgusting behavior that has somehow gotten lost in the shuffle," Kavanaugh wrote in an Aug. 15, 1998, memo to Starr and other lawyers. Kavanaugh has expressed regret that the whole steamy report was publicly released but defended the vigor with which the Starr team pursued Clinton, who was impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate.

(197, 'A sense of inevitability for Kavanaugh, who can transform the court for decades', 'America''s highest court rests on a precipice, with many rights -- related to abortion and university affirmative action, to name just two -- teetering on a single vote.', 'Washington (CNN)When Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor testified in 2009, confirmation seemed so certain that Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham famously predicted she only had to avoid a "complete meltdown." As Judge Brett Kavanaugh takes the witness chair on Tuesday, the sense of inevitability in these partisan times is even greater. Republicans control the Senate, they are tightly managing the vetting process, and Democrats no longer have an opportunity for a filibuster to block a final vote Yet the inevitability is strikingly paradoxical because the stakes for the nine-member Supreme Court are greater than they have been in decades. America''s highest court rests on a precipice, with many rights -- those related to abortion and university affirmative action, to name just two -- teetering on a single vote. The chance also exists that this deeply divided bench could end up resolving a dispute related to investigations involving President Donald Trump. Most significant, of course, is special counsel Robert Mueller''s probe of Russia''s intervention in the 2016 presidential campaign and any ties to Trump''s campaign. Kavanaugh, 53, would succeed Anthony Kennedy, who steadied the bench. A centrist conservative with a 30-year tenure, Kennedy fluctuated in his approach. So, the four liberals had a shot at persuading him to move left on social issues. He cast the decisive vote to uphold abortion rights and affirmative action and, in 2015, to establish for the first time a constitutional right to gay marriage. Yet Kennedy remained with the right-wing bloc in many areas, including as he penned the 2010 Citizens United case rolling back campaign finance regulations for corporations and unions. Based on his record over 12 years on a powerful Washington-based federal appeals court, Kavanaugh would not be so fluid. His vote would not be in play for the liberal side. The result would be a high court less willing to protect individual rights; more willing to reject government regulations, such as those covering consumers and the environment; and ready for a hiatus on groundbreaking decisions favoring LGBT rights. A Yale law graduate with sterling credentials and deep Washington experience, Kavanaugh could have been nominated by any establishment Republican president, rather than only by the rebellious Trump. In fact, Kavanaugh''s name did not appear on Trump''s first or second list of high court candidates in 2016. It appeared only on Trump''s third list, put out in November 2017, perhaps because of his Washington insider connections. Kavanaugh remains closely identified with President George W. Bush, whom he served from 2001 to 2006. During his time with Bush, Kavanaugh assisted with appointments to powerful US appeals courts and three Supreme Court nominations: Chief Justice John Roberts; Associate Justice Samuel Alito; and former White House counsel Harriet Miers, whose nomination for a seat was withdrawn after Bush''s fellow conservatives objected that her credentials were lacking. Senate Republicans, taking advantage of their majority position to control the confirmation process, have blocked Democrats from seeing any of the Kavanaugh documents related to those high court nominations. When Roberts served in the Ronald Reagan administration, he, coincidentally, also helped prepare a nominee, Sandra Day O''Connor, in 1981. Roberts drafted answers to questions that senators were likely to ask. As he later wrote in a September 17, 1981, memo released when he was up for confirmation in 2005, "The approach was to avoid giving specific responses to any direct questions on legal issues likely to come before the court, but demonstrating in the response a firm command of the subject area and awareness of the relevant precedents and arguments."

"Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department," Trump tweeted. "Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff..." A decision by the Justice Department to hold off on prosecuting two Republican congressmen up for re-election in order to help them win would have been highly unethical and a blatantly politically motivated violation of the department''s nonpartisan mission. The comment on Monday was the latest indication that Trump, who ran on a pledge to "drain the swamp," believes his political allies should be immune from prosecution, regardless of the evidence stacked against them. The Justice Department declined to comment on the President''s tweets. The tweet marked Trump''s latest attack on the Justice Department, which has a long history of carrying out investigations and pursuing indictments in a nonpartisan fashion. Federal prosecutors are strongly admonished not to let politics affect charging decisions in the way the President advocated on Monday. "Politics must play no role in the decisions of federal investigators or prosecutors regarding any investigations or criminal charges. Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party," reads a 2016 Justice Department memorandum issued by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, which mirrors language issued by previous attorneys general ahead of federal elections. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, and Rep. Chris Collins, R-New York, were indicted within two weeks of each other last month on unrelated charges. Collins was charged with 13 counts of securities fraud, wire fraud and making false statements related to an alleged insider trading scheme. Hunter was indicted for using campaign funds for personal use and were charged with counts of wire fraud, falsifying records, campaign finance violations and conspiracy. Under long-standing Justice Department custom, prosecutors generally avoid public disclosure of overt investigative steps involving a candidate for office or election matters within 60 days of an election. But the so-called, 60-day rule is not an official regulation or found in any federal statute. Instead, it''s up to prosecutors to use their best judgment and, above all else, make sure that political considerations play no role in investigative decisions. Republican congressional leadership considered the charges serious enough to move to strip both men of their committee assignments. Collins suspended his campaign days after he was indicted, while Hunter is continuing to campaign for re-election. AshLee Strong, a spokesperson for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, responded to Trump''s tweet by saying the Justice Department "should always remain apolitical, and the speaker has demonstrated he takes these charges seriously." Republican Sen. Ben Sasse, of Nebraska, also reacted to the tweet, saying, "The United States is not some banana republic with a two-tiered system of justice -- one for the majority party and one for the minority party. These two men have been charged with crimes because of evidence, not because of who the President was when the investigations began. Instead of commenting on ongoing investigations and prosecutions, the job of the President of the United States is to defend the Constitution and protect the impartial administration of justice." The tweet was just the latest instance in which Trump has defended one of his political allies despite significant evidence of wrongdoing and a federal prosecution. Trump also defended his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and insisted he was unfairly treated, even after Manafort was found guilty on eight counts of financial crimes. While Trump suggested the investigations into the two lawmakers began during the Obama administration, the charges against Collins stem from actions he allegedly took last year -- including calls he placed while at the White House for a congressional picnic hosted by Trump. The Justice Department also began investigating Hunter last year, with the House Ethics Committee announcing in March 2017 that it was holding off on taking action against Hunter because the Justice Department had launched a criminal investigation into his use of campaign funds. The tweet also amounts to Trump''s latest broadside against his attorney general, whose recusal from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign Trump has refused to forgive and continued to fume about. In a second tweet, Trump said Democrats "must love" Sessions and likened the situation to Democrats support for former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired last year. "The Dems all hated him, wanted him out, thought he was disgusting  UNTIL I FIRED HIM! Immediately he became a wonderful man, a saint like figure in fact. Really sick!" Trump tweeted.

(200, 'Trump comes out swinging ahead of big political week', 'President Donald Trump couldn''t wait to launch into the fall political season, an intense 10-week conflagration that marks a hugely consequential chapter in his turbulent presidency.', '(CNN)President Donald Trump couldn''t wait to launch into the fall political season, an intense 10-week conflagration that marks a hugely consequential chapter in his turbulent presidency. He spent Labor Day, when campaign politicking goes into overdrive, unleashing a raging tweet storm blasting his beleaguered Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other favorite targets, such as fired FBI Director James Comey, officials leading the Russian probe and the media. But the critical period that might lay the foundations for the nation''s ideological course for years and even decades to come will truly get underway on Tuesday morning when confirmation hearings start for Trump''s second Supreme Court pick, Brett Kavanaugh. The likely confirmation of Kavanaugh will drag the court to the right and make an ardent conservative, Chief Justice John Roberts, the bench''s swing vote. It is a scenario that may take several Democratic presidencies to undo, could supercharge conservative voters and will on its own elevate the Trump presidency to undeniable historic significance. The battle that unfolds in Room 216 of the Hart Senate Office Building will also juice the fight between the parties before November''s midterm elections -- the culmination of weeks of political combat that could have grave implications for the Trump presidency itself. The elections, for the entire House of Representatives, one third of the Senate and a clutch of critical gubernatorial and statehouse races, will mark the first time a nationwide electorate has had the chance to cast judgment on Trump''s tumultuous impact as the 45th president. If history is any guide, Trump could be slammed by a corrective wave building since his 2016 election triumph that sweeps Democrats to significant gains, including the possible capture of the House. This would be a nightmare scenario for Trump, since it could tighten a vise of investigations around his White House or even lead to impeachment hearings. But if the President drives his fabled political base to the polls in sufficient numbers to save the House he would surely interpret his triumph as validation of his tempestuous style and emerge more powerful and even less constrained than ever before. In between the Kavanaugh hearings and the midterms, a succession of challenges loom, from the Mueller investigation to the stuttering effort to force North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, that will have considerable implications for Trump and the rest of the world. Everyone else might have been enjoying the last long weekend of summer on Monday. But for Trump, there is no off season for attack politics. After aborting an apparent trip to play golf on a steamy Monday afternoon, he set off on a Twitter tear against some of his favorite targets. First, he lambasted Sessions, this time over corruption indictments laid against Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York, the first two House members to endorse him. "Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff....," Trump tweeted. The intervention held a mirror up to Trump''s mood and nature: It revealed his nervousness about the midterms and his disdain for the traditional firewall between the White House and the Justice Department, meant to guard against the politicization of the law. It again hinted at the thin ice under Sessions, who Trump appears to believe should be acting as his own personal protector and lawyer rather than as an independent guardian of justice. Several Republican senators appear to have softened their support for Sessions in recent weeks, sparking speculation that the President could dismiss him after the midterm elections, a period that could be especially volatile if Democrats win the House. Trump told Bloomberg Sessions'' job was safe at least until then. Some Trump critics fear that the President could dispense with Sessions, who is recused from the Russia investigation, in order to get an attorney general that could frustrate it or even prevent the public release of any final report that Mueller chooses to write. It remains unclear however whether the President could get a nominee with such an agenda through Senate confirmation. Trump on Monday also seized on a more positive aspect of his midterm election message, the strength of the economy, at the start of the week that will include the latest jobs report from his government. "The U.S. is respected again!" Trump wrote, as he retweeted a message from his press secretary, Sarah Sanders, from which GOP leaders would love him never to deviate. "Our economy is booming, millions are working again, and our country is back on the right track thanks to President @realDonaldTrump''s policies. Happy Labor Day!" Sanders wrote. Robust economic growth and low unemployment constitute the best incentive Republicans can put before voters this fall. But there is also an argument to be made that Trump''s approval ratings -- he dipped to just 36% in one recent poll -- should be far higher given current prosperity. The fact they are not could be a warning sign that Trump''s disinclination to reach out to voters that do not already support him could help doom many Republican lawmakers come November. Another dark cloud hanging over the midterm elections is the Russia investigation. Washington is waiting to see whether special counsel Robert Mueller will make any significant moves in the intensely political period ahead or whether he will choose to try to insulate his prosecutors from Republican accusations of trying to influence voters. The White House has given every sign that it would welcome a campaign season clash with Mueller as a way to fan scare talk of impeachment that could convince any wavering Trump voters that their champion needs their support at the polls. Trump''s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has promised to put out his own report debunking notions of Russian collusion or obstruction of justice. Trump must also worry about widening legal complications from the guilty plea lodged by his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen in a tax and fraud case in which prosecutors also granted immunity to the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. His worries on this score may intersect with the Kavanaugh hearings since a debate is expected on the extent to which the President should be exposed to legal scrutiny while in office. Despite being an aggressive member of independent counsel Kenneth Starr''s team during the Lewinsky scandal that led to Bill Clinton''s impeachment, Kavanaugh now appears to believe that Congress should shield sitting presidents from civil and criminal cases and takes a sweeping view of executive power. He is likely to face calls from Democrats to recuse himself from any such cases that make it to the Supreme Court. Though the Republican majority in the Senate and the demise of the filibuster rule for Supreme Court nominees means Kavanaugh is likely to be confirmed, both parties will use this week''s confirmation hearings to engage their most committed activists before the midterms. Republicans will effectively be making good on a bargain that Trump made with evangelical voters -- an important part of his coalition that has held firm despite questions over his conduct and character -- following his vow to anoint authentic conservatives to the Supreme Court. Democrats are likely to use the hearings to build on fears among liberals that the right to have an abortion could be at risk from the new Supreme Court''s conservative lurch -- a factor that could send moderate voters flocking to the polls in November. Trump will be sure to capitalize on the Kavanaugh hearing when he kicks his midterm campaign into a higher gear at the end of the week, with visits to Montana and North and South Dakota. Before then, his administration is braced for the resumption of trade talks with Canada, following his warning to exclude the US ally and top export market from the new iteration of the North American Free Trade Agreement that he put at the center of his 2016 campaign.

Don''t make excuses when you are dealing with real physical symptoms, or wait for a medical emergency before you see a doctor. The author''s cervical spine before surgery showing spinal cord compression in three areas.\n								\n									 (Courtesy of the author) I never wanted to take sick days from work because I was always worried it would impact my job, especially since a lot of what I was experiencing was happening while management, schedule and talent changes were happening at Fox News. But I had no choice when my medical problem turned into a crisis in early July while I was hosting “Fox & Friends First.” Shooting pains started ricocheting through the right side of my head. I made it through the show and went home immediately afterward, hoping my ferocious headache would go away. The next day, thinking I was better, I went back to work and it happened again – only worse. Again, I went immediately home, hoping the terrible pain would go away. It didn’t – for four long days. I went in to the hospital for an MRI of my brain. Thankfully, I saw an outstanding neurologist – Dr. Ludmilla Bronfin. During my initial exam, she also tested my reflexes and discovered they were overactive – a condition called hyperreflexia, which can be caused by a variety of conditions. As a result, she ordered an MRI not only of my brain, but also of my neck. Then Dr. Bronfin gave me frightening news and told me I had a medical condition I’d never even heard of. “There’s a 100 percent chance you won’t be walking when you are older,” the doctor said. “You could hit a pothole the wrong way and be paralyzed right now." Dr. Bronfin told me there was nothing wrong with my brain – wonderful news! But the doctor said I had a serious problem with my spine – something called cervical spinal stenosis with myelopathy. In plain English, that means my spinal cord was being dangerously compressed in my neck. Dr. Bronfin told me I needed surgery as soon as possible to keep things from getting any worse, so I wouldn’t eventually become paralyzed because of spinal cord compression. Turns out that the compression of my spine began years ago when I was in a car wreck as a 16-year-old, resulting in traumatic injuries to my head and neck. I didn’t know it, but the trauma to my neck had apparently slowly been getting worse and worse over the years. I never even thought about my neck, and as a result, I ignored some very key warning signs. In the year prior to my surgery, I had been experiencing moments when my legs felt numb – not a tingly-numb, but a dead and heavy numb feeling where I would beat my legs to try to make the feeling come back. Other times, I experienced shooting pains and cramping in my legs. Every time it happened I had an excuse. I blamed it on low potassium, lack of sleep (I start work at 1 a.m.), or stress. I had been diagnosed with low iron and vitamin D deficiency. I was also experiencing issues with bowel control – I’ll spare you the details. And I was having shooting pains in my arms. I actually went to an emergency room one time because I thought I was having a heart attack after anchoring all-night coverage during the presidential debates. I was told there was nothing wrong with my heart so I went right back to work for our next night of coverage. I blamed the pains in my arms on too much caffeine and lack of sleep. Heather and her dad recovering at home in North Carolina.\n								\n									 (Courtesy of the author) Fast forward to this past April. I covered a story at Fort Bragg, where I rappelled down a 45-foot wall. At the time, I couldn’t physically turn my neck to look down no matter how hard I tried to force it. I had experienced a “stiff neck” for years. I had blamed it – again – on stress, lack of sleep, or other little things. I considered this a nuisance, not a serious health issue. As for this particular incident at Fort Bragg – I just blamed it on being terrified 45 feet up in the air! But after this incident, what had previously been sporadic bouts of numb legs turned into flat-out falling down, with my right leg dragging. My arms began to have the same weak feeling as my legs, where I could barely raise them long enough to wash my hair. My hands had begun to ache. I had begun to drop things, like my all-important coffee in the morning! Still, in my mind, I had excuses for everything – and I never thought that all my problems were related. Thanks to Dr. Bronfin, I now know that all my problems were the result of my spinal cord being compressed in my neck. After my MRI, I consulted with four different neurosurgeons in person and three others looked at my MRI results remotely. They all said the same thing, I needed surgery – and I needed it soon. Cervical spinal stenosis with myelopathy isn’t curable, but surgery can stop symptoms from progressing. And my symptoms were progressing all too rapidly. I was very lucky to have one of the very best neurosurgeons, Dr. Paul McCormick with the Spine Center at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. An image following after surgery showing titanium plate, screws and implants from bone bank\n								\n									 (Courtesy of the author) The surgery itself involved three areas of my spine in my neck. The affected discs and bone spurs were removed from an incision in the front of my neck. Dr. McCormick then fused together the open spaces between the vertebrae by implanting a bone graft from a bone bank and then secured everything together with a titanium metal plate and screws. I was fitted with a neck brace and have worn it nonstop since the surgery July 13 – shower and sleep included! I was warned I might have problems with my voice after surgery, but aside from a cough for a couple weeks, my voice is back to normal. I was also back up and walking almost immediately, albeit very slowly! I am now up to walking two miles in about 90 minutes. For someone who loves to rollerblade, run, bike, golf and engage in other athletic activity, it has been a bit frustrating to take things so slowly – but I know patience is key. It will take about a year to fully fuse everything together. The biggest blessing in all this has been that after a stay in the hospital I was able to travel to North Carolina to recover at home with my parents. While I was recovering, my dad was finishing up radiation treatments for prostate cancer. He was diagnosed a year ago, about the same time all of this started with me. It has been quite a year. I can''t say thank you enough to Dr. Paul McCormick and the entire surgical and recovery team at Columbia University Medical Center and Presbyterian Hospital. Thank you as well to Dr. Ludmilla Bronfin. And I want to thank Dr. Marc Siegel, a professor of medicine and internist at the New York University Langone Medical Center who – fortunately for me – is also a medical analyst and reporter for Fox News. He helped me every step of the way and without him I couldn’t have ended up with such a great medical team. Also, thank you to my mother, sister and boyfriend who came to New York to be with me through the surgery and the immediate days afterward. My mother gets double thanks for continuing to take care of me and my dad while we both recovered at home in North Carolina. Finally, thank you to all of the Fox News viewers who have reached out to me the past few weeks with kind words and who have told me they prayed for my recovery. You are so kind and thoughtful. And now your prayers have been answered and am back at Fox News! God bless you all. By the time many of you read this – if it’s after 5 a.m. ET Tuesday – I will have wrapped up my return on “Fox & Friends First.” I look forward to many, many more early mornings with my friends on the show and with our wonderful viewers.

(202, 'NBC News says Ronan Farrow''s draft story on Harvey Weinstein for the network contained misstatements', 'In a 10-page internal report, NBC News said Ronan Farrow''s reporting on Harvey Weinstein for The New Yorker bore little resemblance to the material it chose not to report last year.', 'NBC News alleged in an internal report Monday that the writer Ronan Farrow had taken a source''s comments out of context in his reporting on sexual harassment claims against the movie producer Harvey Weinstein while he was working for the network and had misrepresented the source''s willingness to identify Weinstein by name. The allegation was included in a 10-page report sent to employees four days after The New York Times quoted Farrow''s former NBC producer as having said "the very highest levels of NBC" ordered Farrow to stop his work on the investigation. The producer, Rich McHugh, left NBC News last month. NBC News said it allowed Farrow to take his reporting to The New Yorker because he didn''t have any individuals willing to go on the record. Responding to the Times'' report last week, it said, "The assertion that NBC News tried to kill the Weinstein story while Ronan Farrow was at NBC News, or even more ludicrously, after he left NBC News, is an outright lie." The internal report said NBC News had two investigative reporters and a senior editor review Farrow''s draft script and its underlying reporting. It said the team "was again unanimous that NBC News did not yet have a story that was ready for broadcast." It alleged that in a draft script, Farrow included an excerpt from an interview with a former employee of Weinstein''s that misrepresented what the source said. "After reviewing the full transcripts the Editorial Review Team discovered the script took his comments out of context, misrepresenting him as if he were willing to identify Weinstein when in fact he had only agreed to speak broadly of Hollywood executive behavior, and said on camera: ''I''m not comfortable'' specifically naming Harvey Weinstein," the report said. Farrow said in a statement early Tuesday that the NBC News report contained "numerous false or misleading statements," asserting that it was the network''s idea that he take his reporting elsewhere, not his, and that "I took them up on it only after it became clear that I was being blocked from further reporting." Farrow said that the network''s legal and standards departments both approved his reporting, "only to be blocked by executives who refused to allow us to seek comment from Harvey Weinstein." He said he would have more to say "at the right time." The New Yorker declined to comment. In a statement on Twitter, McHugh said: "I''m not clear how NBC''s report can be considered objective and thorough given I was never interviewed for the report and only learned about it when asked for comment by reporters late last week." NBC recently published a memo and "fact sheet" from Andy Lack regarding their handling of the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault story that was never aired.  Here is my response: pic.twitter.com/H9RbsW78jB The report also said that during an interview, Farrow misled Ken Auletta, The New Yorker''s media critic, leading Auletta him to believe that Farrow "had multiple women willing to be identified by name" while he was still at NBC News. In fact, the network said, "there was not a single victim of — or witness to — misconduct by Weinstein who was willing to be identified." According to the report, Farrow interviewed two people on camera while he worked on the story at NBC News. Those people were Auletta — who it said was reacting to "misleading information provided by Farrow — and the actor Rose McGowan, who it said sent NBC News a cease-and-desist letter refusing permission for the network to use her interview, in which she refused to name Weinstein. In February, McGowan confirmed to the Los Angeles Times: "I started a cease-and-desist at NBC. It was me that spiked it. It wasn''t the place for it." The network also alleged that Farrow told editors that two women had accused Weinstein of misconduct toward them, even though his own notes at the time showed that they had "made only general allegations and had yet to provide any specific details." Weinstein has denied all allegations of abuse against him. Farrow took his reporting to The New Yorker in August 2017. The magazine published its article two months later, after Farrow went to the magazine with "very serious reporting already accomplished," the magazine''s editor in chief, David Remnick, said last year. Farrow expanded the piece "with extremely hard work, and with work with a lot of my colleagues here at The New Yorker," Remnick said. The internal report contended that the final New Yorker article bore little resemblance to what Farrow had been pushing to report at NBC News. The New Yorker article identified eight women by name. NBC News said seven of the women were never included in Farrow''s reporting at the network, while the eighth refused to let her name be used. "Throughout the eight months that NBC News had supported and guided his work, Farrow''s editors repeatedly told him that the story needed at least one credible on-the-record accusation from someone willing to be identified — a standard he still had not met," the network said. In a separate cover letter, NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack said: "Contrary to recent allegations, at no point did NBC obstruct Farrow''s reporting or ''kill'' an interview." Lack said the network had, in fact, repeatedly rebuffed efforts by representatives for Weinstein to interfere with Farrow''s reporting. "In each instance, their calls were either completely ignored or met with a boilerplate commitment to allow them to comment if and when something was ready for broadcast," Lack said. "We will continue to pursue the toughest stories, in the most challenging circumstances, involving the most powerful people," Lack said. "And we will keep doing it while upholding the journalistic standards that have been the backbone of this outstanding news organization."

Meituan-Dianping, which bills itself as a “one-stop super app” that offers everything from food delivery to travel bookings, has set an IPO price range of HK$60 to HK$72 (about $7.64 to $9.17), with a valuation of $46 billion to $55 billion, according to Reuters. That is still less, however, than the valuation of about $60 million it targeted earlier, according to a June 25 report from the Wall Street Journal. Meituan-Dianping runs the leading online marketplace for services in China by gross transaction volume and also acquired bike-sharing startup Mobike earlier this year. Meituan-Dianping was said to be valued at as much as $30 billion when it raised a $4 billion Series C round led by Tencent in October 2017. But the company’s tight margins and losses, much of which were incurred on marketing and user acquisition, are raising concerns about Meituan-Dianping’s valuation, especially after Xiaomi’s underwhelming debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in July. Despite reports that it sought a valuation of $100 billion, Xiaomi ended up with a $54 billion valuation after raising $4.7 billion. A document filed today with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange didn’t provide more information about IPO pricing or valuation, but it did give some insights into the company’s financials. It said that Meituan-Dianping’s total revenues increased by 161.2% to RMB 33.9 billion in 2017, and by an additional 94.9% from RMB 8.1 billion in the four months ending in April 30, 2017 to RMB 15.8 billion in the same period of 2018. In 2017, the platform generated over 5.8 billion transactions, totalling RMB 357 billion in gross transaction volume. It served 310 million transacting users and 4.4 million active merchants, with each transacting user making an average of 20.3 transactions in the 12 months ending April 30, 2018. Meituan-Dianping recorded a gross margin of 9.3% for food delivery in the four months ending on April 30, 2018, while its second-largest business segment, in-store, hotel and travel services, recorded gross margin of 88% in the same period. Overall, the company had gross margin of 25.5% in that time frame. In the same periods, however, it also recorded high net losses. In 2017, the company said it recorded net losses of RMB 19 billion, as well as net losses of RMB 8.2 billion and RMB 22.8 billion for the four months ending on April 30 2017 and 2018, respectively. Meituan-Dianping said the losses were due in changes to the fair value of its preferred shares, user acquisition expenses, including incentives to attract users and delivery riders, and new product launches. The pressure of acquiring new users and marketing expenses probably won’t ease up anytime soon, as Meituan-Dianping faces down rivalry from Alibaba.

(204, 'Why Australia loses prime ministers', 'Not one has served a full term since 2007', 'IN THE quarter of a century to 2007, Australia had three prime ministers. Since then not a single one has survived a full three-year term. First went Kevin Rudd, a Labor leader who was replaced by his deputy, Julia Gillard, in 2010. When her popularity plummeted, he knifed her in return but lost a general election shortly after. That led to the installation of Tony Abbott, a hardline conservative, as prime minister in 2013. But he lasted only until 2015 before being toppled by the more moderate Malcolm Turnbull. Last month, following a coup fomented by Mr Abbott’s hard-right bloc, Mr Turnbull lost his job. Scott Morrison, the former treasurer, is now prime minister. That brings the total to six in 11 prosperous years. Why does Australia keep losing leaders? Its politicians can replace their bosses in a vote by party MPs known as a leadership “spill”. These can happen quickly and brutally, with the winner requiring just 50% of the vote. Spills were rare before this century, so some ascribe their increasing popularity to a modern preoccupation with opinion polls and popularity. Parties often bet that replacing a prime minister will boost support before the next election. A series of weak leaders, nursing personal vendettas, has only added to the problem. (Labor’s spills were built on the battle between Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard. Among the conservatives, Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott started attacking each other as early as 2009). “We’ve set a precedent,” observes Michael Fullilove of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank. “We are waiting for a prime minister who can break it.” Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. Other causes relate to the peculiarities of Australia’s parliamentary system. First, its three-year electoral cycle is among the shortest anywhere in the world. Prime ministers are barely sworn in before parties start thinking about the next election. Second, the Australian senate is one of the world’s most powerful. It can neuter governments that do not control it, and not many governments do. The upper house is elected by proportional representation and is now dominated by a menagerie of minor parties and independents. Third, it is compulsory to vote in Australia. Ian McCallister, a professor at the Australian National University, estimates that up to 18% of voters take part only because they have to. This cohort is drawn to style over substance, he says, and has underscored a deep culture of personality politics in Australia. The churn might be easier to understand if Australians were hard done-by. But the economy has not been in recession for 27 years. The coups are increasingly counterproductive. Australians have grown sick of the insecurity they precipitate, and profess historically low trust in their politicians. Support for the Liberals has crashed to its lowest level in a decade after the latest upheaval. But change is possible. After its back and forth, Labor installed rules in 2013 that made it harder to knife the leader. They must now be elected by both MPs and members over a month-long process that is intended to prompt deliberation. Politicians who want to force a spill must deliver a petition signed by 60% of their colleagues. (Liberal rebels, by comparison, still need only half.) Mr Rudd argued recently that the change has made it impossible to “launch a coup at the drop of a hat”. His successor, Bill Shorten, is unpopular with voters, but has survived unchallenged for almost six years. The Liberals might learn something from that.

But a new study finds that exposure to the views of others, minus their political affiliation, could help us overcome our own biases. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, led by sociologist Damon Centola, examined how people’s interpretations of some commonly misunderstood climate change data changed after seeing those of people in opposing political parties. The theory is that by exposing people to information sans partisan affiliation, we might be able to break the “motivated reasoning” that leads us to interpret data in a preconceived way. The data in this case was a NASA study indicating that sea ice levels will decrease but frequently misinterpreted as suggesting the opposite. The misunderstanding isn’t entirely partisan in nature: 40 percent of self-identified Republicans and 26 percent of Democrats polled in the study adopted the mistaken latter view. Thousands from both parties, recruited via Mechanical Turk, were asked to indicate whether sea ice levels were rising or falling, and how much. After their initial guess, they were shown how others had answered and allowed to adjust their answer afterwards. Some were shown their peers answers with those peers’ political affiliation, and some were shown it without. When political party was not attached to the answers, there was a considerable effect on people’s answers. Republicans jumped from about 65 percent getting it right to around 90, and Democrats went from 75 to 85 percent. When party was shown, improvements were much smaller; and when people were only exposed to those from their own party, there was practically no improvement at all. Obviously this isn’t going to fix the problem of viral misinformation or the near-constant flame wars raging across every major online service. But it’s amazing that doing something as simple as stripping the political context from communications may lead to those communications being taken more seriously. Perhaps something along these lines could help put the brakes on runaway articles: showing highly-cited views from people with no indication of their political beliefs. Will you be so quick to dismiss or accept someone’s argument if you can’t be sure of their agenda? At worst it may force people to take a second and evaluate those ideas on their merits, and that’s hardly a bad thing. The study was published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The students claim that the university has systematically chosen less qualified applicants of other races over more qualified Asian-Americans. The case reflects deep-seated divisions over affirmative action in America, where the debate revolves mainly around access to education. Affirmative action describes the practice of giving preference to members of certain groups, for example in terms of university admissions, government contracts or jobs, often in an attempt to rectify historical discrimination or persecution. In India the state uses quotas for dalits, who are the country’s lowest caste group, in government jobs and public universities. In Malaysia, affirmative action works in favour of Malays, who have historically been poorer than their Chinese and Indian counterparts. And Norway, Italy and Belgium are among countries that require a certain percentage of board members at listed companies to be women. Advocates for affirmative action believe that such policies are needed to tackle deep-seated prejudices and systemic discrimination. Opponents contend that such an approach is unfair, since two wrongs don’t make a right, and does more harm than good, as The Economist has argued. Another group believes that some people deserve a leg-up but disagree on the grounds for qualification. It’s a complicated, fraught topic. To debate it we have invited Ella Whelan, a journalist, to argue in favour of the motion, and Julia Sass Rubin, an academic, to argue against. Opening statements appear today, rebuttals are on Wednesday, and closing arguments are published on Friday. Voting is open until Sunday evening.

If I had been asked to write this statement because I was a woman, and because The Economist needed to make up its quota of female writers that week, I’d like to think that I would decline. Not because I don’t want the job, but because any pride I have in my work and my ability would stop me from doing so. Affirmative action is an insult. It suggests that individuals from certain backgrounds need a leg up to be able to achieve what the rest of society does with ease. Supporters claim that it’s a necessary evil, that until the world is a better place we need affirmative action to give minorities a space at the table. No one wants to be nominated for an award or hired for a job on the basis of their skin colour, sexuality or gender. However, until society is less intrinsically male, pale and stale, certain people should take all the help they can get. There are two problems with this view. The first is that supporters of affirmative action imagine that the world is stacked against them, and that the barriers life might throw at them are too difficult to face. As a woman, I’m often told that I might find it harder to speak up in meetings, or might shy away from asking for job opportunities because I’m too naturally polite. Anyone who has met me knows that isn’t quite the case. Despite the fact that women are excelling in all aspects of public life (even out-earning men in their twenties), I’m still considered in need of charity because of my gender. The second problem is that affirmative action underestimates how far society has come from the days of real and ugly discrimination. Fifty years ago, when life was a lot more fraught with inequality, it wasn’t handouts or leg-ups that won people their freedom, but direct action, collective organisation and radical demands for equality. When the Bristol Omnibus Company refused to employ black or Asian workers in 1963, a group of young West African and West Indian men organised a protest which boycotted the buses until they ended the discriminatory practice. As a result, the Race Relations Act was passed in Britain in 1965 which stopped racial discrimination in public places, later followed by a further act in 1968 to cover housing and employment. Likewise, the 1968 Dagenham female strikers at Ford didn’t need affirmative action to win fair pay for their work, they went on strike until they won it for themselves. We no longer live in a systematically racist, sexist, discriminatory society. We have those who fought past struggles for freedom to thank for that. And those battles that some of us still face will not be won with calls for special treatment of minorities. Supporters of affirmative action forget the power of workers, and individuals, to stand up for their rights and demand their equality. Crying for pity quotas from the big boss won’t get us anywhere. If we want to be treated like equals, we must recognise affirmative action for what it is: lazy tokenism. Ella Whelan is a columnist for spiked magazine and author of What Women Want: Fun, Freedom and an End to Feminism. Affirmative action refers to efforts to provide equal opportunity in educational admissions, employment hiring, and promotion to those of different races, ethnicities, income levels and physical abilities. Affirmative action is necessary because our society is not meritocratic. In fact, preferential treatment based on income, race and ethnicity is the norm. I write this as someone who has benefitted from those privileges. As a white, upper-middle class woman from a highly-educated family, I never had to worry about whether I would have enough to eat, a safe place to live, or would be able to see a doctor when ill. I never attended underfunded schools with unprepared teachers, inadequate textbooks, unsafe or dilapidated facilities, and fellow students who were hungry, traumatized by violence, or exhausted from holding down two jobs to help feed their families. My parents had the knowledge, time and ability to help me with my schoolwork or to open doors by connecting me with others in their social networks. Teachers and employers never assumed that I was not smart or competent because of my skin color, ethnicity or accent. These privileges provided me with many advantages over others who worked just as hard or perhaps even harder than I did but were not as fortunate. In America, we could address such inequities through public policies, as we did for a short time in the 1960s and 70s. But we are not. Instead, income inequality is increasing dramatically, further limiting access to opportunities. And because income is very unevenly distributed by race and ethnicity, growing income inequality is exacerbating America’s already substantial racial and ethnic inequalities. Affirmative action is also necessary because there is no “objective” way to compare candidates when admitting to universities or hiring for jobs. Supposedly meritocratic selection criteria actually reflect and reinforce our society’s inequities and prejudices, giving tremendous advantages to those already at the top. For example, multiple studies have confirmed that standardised test scores mirror family educational attainment and income, and that job and admission interviews are subject to numerous perceptual biases that favour in-group candidates. Since those doing the selecting are likely to be from more privileged groups, that means others like them have an edge. Only by acknowledging these biases and inequities, and structuring selection to consciously address them, can we make access to opportunities even remotely equitable. There are many reasons to support affirmative action. Diversity of experiences, cultures, and ideas brings immense benefits to classrooms and work environments. For me, however, the most compelling reason to support affirmative action is equity. As an upper-middle class white person, I have benefited from our society’s de facto affirmative action for people like me. That is not right because the family you are born into should not dictate your life chances. I  support affirmative action because I want the economic and demographic composition of an entering college class or a company’s workforce to reflect the broader population from which it is drawn rather than being skewed by privilege. I support affirmative action because everyone in our very unequal society should have an equal opportunity to succeed. Julia Sass Rubin is an Associate Professor at the Edward J.

Missing from the debate on AA is an accounting of the negative externalities associated with it. The Economist did a very interesting piece a few years ago, which drew a connection between the GFC bank bails out & Trump. The basic premise was that while the bails outs were a fantastic deal financially, they created this pool of anger, which may have helped contribute to the rise of Trump. Irrespective of how you feel about Trump, the following is a more clear cut and easier example: Immigration & Brexit. Follow this logic chain:\n-High levels of immigration was clearly a major factor in the Brexit vote.\n-Immigration in Britain is held up as a net positive economically.\n-However this analysis does not take into account the economic damage of Brexit.\n-One this impact is factored in, perhaps the economic benefits of high levels of immigration do not stack up? The same failure of logic applies to a ton of policy initiatives; the policy is assessed on its likely economic impact, but what is not often assessed is how people will feel about it, and how they will react. This is uncomfortable to face, because you are in effect saying "there are people we think are fundamentally wrong and misguided, but we should be seriously taking their views into effect, because they may well act on their views". The response is usually "but we should not be giving in or pandering to ''these sorts of people". And of course that is the correct ideological position. But the reality of assessing the impact of policy demands you should take this factor into account. Because like it or not, Brexit happened. It happened and if immigration in Britain had been lower, it would almost certainly not have happened. Analysis needs to face that stark and uncomfortable truth. As for AA; the factor being missed from an assessment of its value, is the negative externalities associated with how people ''feel'' about AA. And without any strong stats or sources to back me up, I can safely say that a ton of people really, really hate it. And that hate, and the actions that flow from it, need to be considered as a negative externality of AA I write from NZ, where we have probably the worlds most advanced racially based affirmative action policies (I think), helping the Maori people for past wrongs during the colonial period. This has been undoubtedly great for Maori, and economically is a undoubted success. However there is a very large portion of the population who angrily rejects the idea of racially based benefits. And as a result our society is a less pleasant place, with a lot of negative racial feeling, and the associated ills. I do not pretend to know in the case of American AA, or NZ AA, whether the benefits outweigh the negatives. But I do feel that they should be weighed against each other, which currently is not happening. Many commentators in US politics have pointed out an uptick in racial animosity from about 2000 to present. This roughly corresponds to when students who were enrolled during affirmative action programs entered the electorate. The truth is a lot of people watched minorities be held to a lower standard and still fail, while disrupting the education of others or being given opportunities more qualified people were denied based on racial quotas. I don''t believe that these externalities have been honestly accounted for. 1).  The 2003 Grutter ruling has a complete and detailed matrix now ready for implementation (DOJ case DJ 169-73-0) The Binno legal team  VS LSAC has all of the documents, letters and transcripts necessary to end AA for law school which has always been the very heart of AA and with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals stating in the Hopwood trial, AA cannot be applied to the undergrad educational platform for no individual has been denied access to Education.   Also note that Edward Blum spoke with myself just this last August (08/06/18) in understanding the Matrix, the involvement of the AG (Ashcroft) in 2005 an the legal team involved in representing Angelo Binno......Their is no longer a need to place students at odds with one another.....Game, set & match......We will see if the ABA, DOJ/DoE and LSAC steps in to announce the matrix and its structure that will now resolve the Grutter Impasse and as John Roberts has stated within many of his interviews, no student has ever been denied access to education and if I favor one group over the other, then the problem continues....    So we will now see how this all plays out...... Affirmative action, as put in the field of post-secondary education and employment, is more than a day late and a dollar short.  Much damage is already done to the prospects of those disadvantaged minorities well before they get to that point.  Damage that, if prevented during childhood, could dramatically reduce the need for such policies.  Better nutrition and early childhood education would have improved the lot of those people who now have to rely on a system of static quotas in order to take their place among peers that have never had to deal with these issues.  Our tendency to abandon the generational poor, those who do not have the same tools as even the lower middle classes of basic household maintenance, rather than try and bring them up to a standard that allows them to flourish academically, is where we ought to concentrate. Instead we allow parasitic industries of highly processed food makers, slum lords, and payday loan sharks, to feed off of these people until they are so weak they cannot work to better themselves and wonder why we have to make special places for their poor, under-fed and under-educated children. Affirmative action should go away, but only after we actually have no need of it.  As of now it should focus on class, rather than race, and America should admit it not only has a class system but that it is exploitative and damaging. I think inequality is a big problem and should be addressed, both as a matter of fairness, and to enrich society by discovering potential brilliant leaders, artists, scientists, etc. that might otherwise be undiscovered.  However, race is just a proxy for other factors that are more relevant, such as income and parent''s education level.  A more fair affirmative action policy would be based on these factors.  This method would not set a standard that a certain race or gender is expected to score lower in perpetuity. Affirmative action is but a small part of a university’s admissions policy. It is up to the institution to use it judiciously – to protect its academic freedom for diverse voices – a prerequisite for democracy.\nAny public policy risks becoming a dogma of correctness. What is a "qualified candidate"? A brooding future poet, artist, or actor? A math or coding whiz kid? If both are genuine, they probably don’t need a university. But a university needs both (and more), and it alone knows the right candidate and the right mix to provide a balanced learning environment. The humanities require us to ask questions and make our case, not to sue to win admission.\nLet’s take politics out of a private university''s (or any university’s) admissions policy. If we don''t allow our higher education institutions academic freedom, if we don''t trust them, our society is in deep trouble. Our society will be in deep trouble (and we''re already seeing the negative effects in the US), when the most elite universities, which are meant to train the most intellectually capable, are forced to take in people who are below the necessary standard. Not only are these people unlikely to benefit from such an education, but they are also taking the opportunity away from a more deserving candidate who is more likely to bring about positive change with the same schooling. The reality of the situation is more mundane. A student turned down so that an AA student could be accepted was a marginally acceptable student for that school anyway. That student will have to find another university, likely one where her credentials are a better fit  to the student population than the one where she was marginally acceptable (except for the AA impact. She will likely  benefit from that outcome, while the AA student who displaced her will be harmed. But none of this matters one iota to the supporters of affirmative action. The only ''privilege'' worth discussing here is economic - it''s not based on race or gender. Unless private education, tutors and inheritance are all banned then there is a high likelihood that the family you are born into will dictate your life chances. Since the inception of affirmative action, the disparities, have only gotten worse.  Just review Thomas Sowell''s "Discrimination and Disparities" to follow historically what has happened.

(208, '“The Other Side of the Wind” dazzles, puzzles and intrigues', 'Orson Welles’s unfinished, experimental final film has been completed. Can it truly be considered one of his?', 'ORSON WELLES’S new film premiered last week at Venice, which is not bad going for a director who died 33 years ago. Welles started on “The Other Side of the Wind” in 1970, when he was 55, but his golden-boy glory days were far behind him. Unable to raise the money he needed to finish his experimental, semi-autobiographical drama, he abandoned it in 1976, and it seemed destined to remain just another entry on the voluminous, tantalising list of his unrealised works. But last year, various legal obstacles were cleared away and Netflix chipped in the money which no one would give Welles. Over 100 hours of footage were restored and pieced together into a two-hour film. For guidance, the editors used the director’s own notes, as well as the sequences he had already assembled while Peter Bogdanovich, Welles’s friend, served as executive producer. The long, long-awaited result, announces an opening caption, is “an attempt to honour and complete [Welles’s] vision”. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. Editing “The Other Side of the Wind” must have been a phenomenally difficult task. It is not much easier to watch it. As soon as the film begins, it bombards the viewer with a barrage of black-and-white clips, a stroboscope of different faces and perspectives and snatches of conversation. It is as concerned with beat poetry and avant-garde art as it is with conventional narrative cinema. It is exhaustingly fragmentary and clatteringly noisy, but seems to be ahead of its time—and maybe our time, too. “The Other Side of the Wind” certainly anticipates the “found-footage” faux-documentary conceit which was all the rage in horror movies a few years ago. Its central character is a legendary, leonine Hollywood director, Jake Hannaford (played by John Huston), who is having a chaotic party in his mansion to celebrate his 70th birthday. Many of the guests have been asked to chronicle proceedings with their own handheld cameras, so the film we are watching is supposed to be a montage of everything shot by these guests. Friends, associates and hangers-on zip in and out of view, including a wisecracking, fresh-faced acolyte played by Mr Bogdanovich. Bitter critics carp; new-wave directors pay homage. Hannaford himself dodges enquiries about his declining career and whether the party is a way of “getting in touch with the younger generation”. To complicate matters further, Hannaford screens the rushes of his latest work. Shot in colour, the film-within-a-film is a psychedelic hippy thriller which is either a pointed (but not especially funny) parody of Michelangelo Antonioni, an Italian film director, or a flimsy excuse to use lots of shots of Welles’s girlfriend and co-writer, Oja Kodar, running around naked. Indeed, some of the macho attitudes evident in “The Other Side of the Wind” would have been more palatable in the 1970s than they are today. The film’s hard-drinking, cigar-chomping hero—the so-called “Ernest Hemingway of cinema”—is addressed as “Skipper” and compared to the very Prospero who lends his name to this column. He could be seen as a substitute for Huston or Welles himself, or a caricature of a dinosaur who has an inkling of how close he is to extinction. But it isn’t easy to stomach his habit of putting down everyone he sees with a grandiose aphorism, and of addressing a supposedly Native American actress as Pocahontas and Minnehaha. Considering how much the film indulges Hannaford, and how disorientating and frenetic it is in style, it would be interesting to learn how many of Netflix’s subscribers get all the way through it when the streaming service releases “The Other Side of the Wind” in November. Still, it is worth persevering. The film dazzles with its gusto and its formal daring, and intrigues with its postmodernism. Its subject is an ageing director struggling to finish a film and compete with Hollywood’s next generation—and that’s what Welles was too. The jittery editing recalls his “F for Fake”, which came out in 1973, and the structure could be compared to that of his debut masterpiece, “Citizen Kane” (1941), which used numerous subjective viewpoints and a faux-documentary format to fashion a kaleidoscopic portrait of an influential male egotist. But as quintessentially Wellesian as it is, “The Other Side of the Wind” still leaves the viewer pondering questions of authorship. Can it really be said to be an Orson Welles film? If he had completed the project, would it have had that furious pace and that jazzy score? Would it have been more coherent or less? If you admire the talent and the work that have gone into it, whose talent and work are you actually thinking about? Welles would no doubt chuckle at these questions, cigar in hand.

Gordon became a tropical storm late Monday afternoon, and the National Weather Service issued a hurricane warning for the mouth of the Pearl River, which divides Louisiana and Mississippi. Tropical storm and storm surge warnings were in effect along a long stretch of the central Gulf Coast from Morgan City, Louisiana, including Lake Pontchartrain, to the Alabama-Florida border. At 8 a.m. ET, Gordon''s top sustained winds had accelerated to 65 mph. It was about 190 miles east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River and was moving west-northwest at 15 mph. The storm is expected to strengthen into a hurricane when it makes landfall along the northern Gulf Coast, but is then forecast to immediately weaken, according to the National Hurricane Center. The weather service projected that it would turn west-northwestward in the next couple of days and that it was likely to approach the central Gulf Coast on Tuesday afternoon or evening. The National Hurricane Center said tropical storm-force winds would hit parts of southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi coast by late Tuesday, with hurricane conditions also expected in the central Gulf Coast late Tuesday. The Mississippi coast can expect 4 to 7 inches of rain, with locally higher amounts, it said. Tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) from #Gordon are expected to reach the northern Gulf Coast by Tuesday afternoon, with hurricane-force winds (74-plus mph) expected by Tuesday evening. Power outages are possible in many areas: https://t.co/myUKr4N7ok pic.twitter.com/cqig0XPFvV Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards issued a state of emergency and authorized the activation of 200 National Guardsmen to be positioned in the southeast of the state. The Mississippi cities of Gulfport, Biloxi and Long Beach ordered mandatory evacuations of their harbors and marinas, and the U.S. Coast Guard said the ports of New Orleans and of Gulfport and Pascagoula in Mississippi could have to be closed if winds get too strong. Dozes of schools in Louisiana and Mississippi closed ahead of the storm, according to NBC News affiliate WDSU. All tropical storm warnings were canceled for South Florida and the Florida Keys as Gordon moved away, but not until after it had battered the region with heavy rain and winds. Authorities in South Florida and across the Gulf Coast urged people to stay out of the water — warnings that beach lovers like Cameron Armstrong and Matthew Ewbanks ignored on their visit to Gulf Shores on the Alabama Gulf Coast. "We got caught up in the undertow, and we almost died," Armstrong told NBC affiliate WPMI of Mobile on Monday. Ewbanks said: "It almost pulled us straight underneath. I literally had to grab his hand and help him. We got out of it barely alive." Jeff Collier, mayor of Dauphin Island, Alabama, in the Gulf, said the storm was approaching just as the island was finishing up recovery from Hurricane Nate last year. "We''ve just about got things cleaned up," Collier told WPMI. "It''s been a good summer, and hopefully this won''t do too much damage." Ray Coleman, a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, said residents should be on highest alert. "My worry is that people might get hurricane amnesia, where they feel like, ''Oh, last year wasn''t so bad,''" Coleman told NBC affiliate WLBT of Jackson. "My thing is, no two storms are alike. Just because you made it through Hurricane Nate last year doesn''t mean that this one will be the same."

(213, 'Are gender quotas good for business?', 'California is set to implement them in the boardrooms of its listed companies', 'LIBERAL California is on its way to becoming the first American state to mandate gender diversity in companies at board level. A bill approved by the state senate on August 30th requires publicly traded firms headquartered in California to have at least one woman on their boards by the end of next year. By 2021 they would be required to give women at least 40% of board seats. “It’s not only the right thing to do. It’s good for a company’s bottom line.” So said Hannah-Beth Jackson, one of the senators who proposed the bill. Some business leaders are unconvinced and are threatening to launch an appeal against the law. Are they right to worry? It was Norway that pioneered the idea. From 2008 it obliged listed companies to have women in at least 40% of board seats or face dissolution. Over the next five years more than a dozen countries, mostly western European, adopted similar quotas. In Belgium, France and Italy firms that fail to comply can be fined, dissolved or banned from paying directors. Germany, Spain and the Netherlands prefer quotas without sanctions. Britain opted for guidelines, and names and shames companies that fall short. In some countries the share of women among directors of large companies has grown four- or five-fold since 2007. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. Nearly two-thirds of public firms in California have fewer than two female directors. Opponents of quotas say that this reflects the scarcity of women in upper management. A quota, they warn, would see boards being stuffed with inexperienced, token women. Another concern is that a small number of highly qualified women, known as “golden skirts”, would be stretched thinly across too many boards. But in Europe, such fears have not been realised. In large listed European companies “golden trousers” are almost as common: 15% of male directors sit on three or more boards; 19% of female directors do. Worries that quotas would lead to the appointment of under-qualified female directors also appear misplaced. A study of Italy’s 33% quota found that female directors at the biggest firms were more likely than their pre-quota predecessors to have professional degrees and qualifications. Norway’s quota led to a similar outcome. Elsewhere the picture has been more mixed, though, with female directors appointed after quotas likely to be younger, less experienced and, in some countries, foreign. Does any of this affect how well companies do? Some “snapshot” studies show that companies with more women on their boards have better returns and are less likely to be beset by fraud or shareholder battles. But causation is hard to prove. Studies comparing firms’ performance before and after quotas were introduced have been inconclusive. Some have found positive effects on firms’ results; others the opposite. One Italian study found an initial increase in stock price when female directors were elected to firms affected by the quota. But it found no effect on any of seven measures of firms’ performance, including profit, output, debt and return on assets. A French study offers one clue for why the addition of more women has not made a consistent difference. It concluded that the country’s new quota system led to changes in the way the boards made decisions. But there was no change in the substance of the decisions. It also found that the process did not change because the new members were women. It was because they were likely to be outsiders. Perhaps it is too early to judge the effect of quotas on companies’ performance. But if Europe’s experience offers any guidance, expectations that California’s new law could dramatically boost or hurt corporate performance are exaggerated.

The reporters’ crime, the judge read, was to have been found in possession of confidential government material. This, he ruled, was a breach of the country’s colonial-era Official Secrets Act. In fact the journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, had not stolen the documents. The papers had been handed to them by police officers over dinner. The correspondents were arrested upon leaving the restaurant. Soon afterwards a spokesperson for the ruling party, the National League for Democracy, who is also a confidant of Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s de facto leader, said he thought the pair had been deliberately “set up”. Miss Suu Kyi’s civilian government does not control the armed forces or the police. But Myanmar’s then president, Htin Kyaw, another of her close allies, gave authorisation for the case to proceed. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. The sentencing concluded a farcical nine-month trial. One witness had to read out notes written on his hand in order not to forget the location where the pair had been arrested. A police officer failed to show up in the courtroom to testify. The judge fell ill. A police captain told the court that the journalists had indeed been framed. He was promptly jailed himself. No one denies that the massacre the journalists were looking into occurred—not even the army, which admitted responsibility and claimed it had jailed seven soldiers for their involvement. But a few days later Myanmar’s public broadcaster said the soldiers were free again. When the foreign press got hold of the story of the release a spokesperson for the government dismissed it as “false news”. The authorities do not allow foreign journalists to travel freely to Rakhine state, where the army’s brutal response to an attack by Rohingya rebels prompted an exodus of over 700,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh. The government has set up a series of committees to investigate allegations of atrocities by the army, but several foreigners invited to sit on them have quit, describing them as whitewash. The head of the latest inquiry said its job was not to apportion blame. Saddest of all has been the reaction of Miss Suu Kyi. She has refused to defend the two journalists and has parroted the prosecution’s case. She has also failed to speak up for the Rohingyas, a mostly Muslim group that many of her Buddhist supporters deem a threat to their country and religion. She may have decided to adopt this stance in order not to upset the army, fearing that antagonising it might derail the country’s democratic transition for which she battled for so long. But if Burmese journalists end up in jail for trying to uncover the truth about an alleged genocide conducted on her watch, that raises questions about how committed to democracy she really is.

But as the waters recede from what may be the state’s worst floods in a century, few are feeling festive. More than a million people were displaced by the downpours. The state government would like to accept foreign aid to help speed reconstruction, but the central authorities are turning it away. For more than a decade, successive national governments have declined foreign disaster relief as a matter of policy, choosing instead to advertise India’s self-sufficiency. But when the central government turned down a reported offer of $100m for Kerala from the United Arab Emirates (which hosts almost 1m expatriate workers from the state), many flood-victims were furious. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. The anger stems in large part from a sense that Narendra Modi’s government in Delhi is not doing enough to support Kerala. The state’s finance minister, Thomas Isaac, claims that it asked for a 22bn-rupee ($312m) relief package from the central government, but has only been offered 6bn rupees. He argues it is only fair for the centre to compensate the state for the foreign aid it was too proud to accept. Shashi Tharoor, a politician from Kerala belonging to the opposition Congress party, wrote that it was “churlish and irresponsible” to turn down foreign aid when Kerala’s needs “vastly exceed anything that the central government can provide”. Although it turns down hand-outs in emergencies, India is happy to accept foreign development aid. The World Bank says that the country received $2.7bn of it in 2016. But India’s policy of refusing disaster relief is not unique. Chile turned down most outside help after an earthquake in 2010, as did America after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Democratic Republic of Congo went one step further earlier this year, boycotting an international conference to raise money for the war-torn country. Other countries show greater humility. Japan, where GDP per person is 20 times that of India, accepted outside help following an earthquake in 2011. This included 86,400 cans of tuna from the Maldives, which offered $50,000 for Kerala last week but was turned away.

(216, 'Older men are more prone to cognitive impairment from dirty air', 'A new study from China highlights air-pollution concerns', 'LIVING under thick layers of smog is known to cause illness and reduce life expectancy. The degree to which pollution harms the mind is less clear. In theory some of the toxins that get inhaled could damage the nervous system and hamper intellect, but few studies have looked into this. One just has, however, and the results are worrying, particularly for older men. The new study is by Xiaobo Zhang, Xin Zhang and Xi Chen of Peking University, in China. When Dr Zhang returned to China in 2012, after teaching in America, he found it difficult to concentrate during days when the air in Beijing was heavily polluted. He knew from previous research conducted by another lab that young students living in polluted areas performed more poorly in exams, but there was no exploration of whether this held true for a broader population and, if it did, what specific effects the toxins were having on cognitive function. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. To find out, the team looked at tests carried out as part of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a survey by Peking University. In 2010 and 2014 the same group of around 20,000 people were tested in standardised mathematics and given a verbal test in word recognition. Crucially, the CFPS logged precise information about the date and location of each test. Putting this information together allowed the researchers to match test scores at each location with the local air quality as reported by the air-pollution index, a measure that rates pollution levels in different cities across China based on daily readings of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and tiny bits of particulate matter. The index ranges from zero to 500, signifying the highest level of pollution. As they report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers showed that chronic exposure to pollution lowered the scores on the verbal tests, and that the higher the pollution levels were the more the scores dropped. On average, an increase of 13.23 units (one standard deviation) in the pollution index over the course of three years resulted in a reduction of 1.36 points for men and 0.91 points for women, on the 34-point verbal exam. In contrast, mathematics scores were hardly altered by pollution exposure. The effects were particularly dramatic in older men who had no education beyond primary school. The data showed that these men lost an average of 9.18 points on the verbal exam if they were exposed to an increase of 13.23 units of pollution over three years. For men who had attended middle school at least, this loss was reduced to just 1.88 points. Precisely why the mathematics scores barely changed, and why men were harmed most, remains unclear. Dr Zhang speculates that pollutant damage is probably accumulating in the white matter of the brain, which people depend upon more heavily for verbal tasks; and men have less white matter than women. It is possible, too, that men with a poor education may work outside, and are thus more exposed to air pollution. Whatever the reasons, the results ought to be food for thought in polluted cities everywhere.

(217, 'Lebanon’s economy has long been sluggish. Now a crisis looms', 'But the country’s politicians are busy haggling over cabinet posts', 'THE main feature of Beirut’s skyline is not minarets or church steeples, but construction cranes. From the roof of a posh downtown hotel you can see 17 of them, throwing up luxury apartments that cost up to $1m each. Wealthy Lebanese sip wine on their terraces and discuss investment opportunities. They rub shoulders with Gulf tourists drawn by Beirut’s libertine nightlife. Lebanon’s economy relies on tourism, construction and finance for growth. All three seem to be thriving. That, however, is an illusion. The country is tipping into a property slump—and perhaps a banking crisis that threatens its currency. An economic crash could destabilise a country already swamped with refugees and plagued by sectarian divides. Trouble in the banking sector, which draws investors from around the region, might be felt beyond Lebanon’s borders. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. Start with tourism, which was bouncing back from a period of regional unrest. Arrivals hit a five-year high in 2017. But they are still below their peak of 2010 and the industry is fickle. In November Saudi Arabia briefly detained the prime minister, Saad Hariri, and forced him to resign (a move he later reversed). Hotel occupancy plunged by 14 percentage points within a month. Saudi visitors, who account for the biggest share of tourist spending, are down by 19% this year. Investment is sluggish. Kafalat, a firm that guarantees loans for small and medium enterprises, handled 117 tourism projects last year, a 6% drop from 2016. Annualised figures from the first half of 2018 show a further 18% decline. More worrying is the construction industry, which accounts for nearly one in ten jobs. Despite the cranes dotting Beirut, construction is slowing. The number of permits issued in the first half of 2018 was 9% lower than in the same period last year. Property transactions dropped by 17% year on year in the first quarter. Developers fear a deeper slump is coming. For years the central bank subsidised mortgages, offering 30-year loans with interest rates as low as 3%. In March it abruptly halted the scheme. Bankers say it was abused. Instead of buying houses, some borrowers put the principal into higher-interest savings accounts to turn a profit. Many young couples cannot afford unsubsidised loans, which carry rates of 8-9% and shorter repayment periods. Some have cancelled their weddings as a result. Lebanon’s economy was already struggling. Annual GDP growth was 8% in 2010, before neighbouring Syria plunged into civil war. Since then it has averaged less than 2%. The slowdown in the housing market will drag it down further. In Hamra, the commercial hub of west Beirut, electronics stores are almost empty despite deep discounts. Fewer new homeowners means less demand for refrigerators. Many shops have cut salaries or fired staff to get by. “This is the worst it’s been in 40 years. Everything is coming to a halt,” says Rafi Sabounjian, a small-business owner. On paper, at least, the banking sector looks solid. Commercial banks hold $200bn in deposits, four times as much as Jordan, which has more people. The central bank (the Banque du Liban or BdL) sits on $44bn in assets, excluding gold, enough to cover more than two years of imports. Its governor, Riad Salamé, says everything is fine. He points to the months after Mr Hariri’s detention, when the central bank spent $1bn to prop up the Lebanese pound, which is pegged at 1,500 to the dollar. Reserves recovered almost immediately. But those numbers are misleading. In 2016 the BdL pioneered something called “the swap”, a complicated scheme in which it borrows foreign-currency holdings from commercial banks. It uses the dollars to maintain the currency peg. The banks get eye-popping returns, raking in 40% for a one-year loan. With no economic growth, the swap works only if it can attract ever-larger sums. “It’s a pure pyramid scheme,” says Jean Tawile, a banker and adviser to Kataeb, a political party. The BdL does not publish its net reserves. Toufic Gaspard, its former head of research, wagers that “swapped” deposits are worth $65bn—meaning net assets are already negative. Fearing a devaluation, banks are increasingly desperate to attract foreign currency. Interest rates even for short-term deposits are at their highest level in nearly a decade. High rates mean small firms cannot obtain credit. A decade ago commercial lending in Lebanon grew by 15-20% annually. This year it is shrinking. The currency peg has been a pillar of the economy since 1997. Receipts are printed in dollars and pounds; shoppers use the two interchangeably. This is starting to look unsustainable. Devaluation would be painful for a country that imports so heavily. It would be good for exporters—but Lebanon hardly has any. Last year it exported $2.8bn worth of goods, about half as much as Iceland. The current-account deficit is more than 20% of GDP. Lebanese politicians made a fortune from the banking boom. Of its 20 biggest commercial banks, 18 are wholly or partly owned by politicians or well-connected families. Now they seem oblivious to the looming crash. Instead they float fanciful schemes for growth. Some hope Lebanon will become a hub for rebuilding post-war Syria. That plan faces many obstacles, not least that nobody knows who will foot the estimated $200bn bill for reconstruction. Foreign donors pledged $12bn in aid at a conference in Paris in April. But most of this is loans, not grants, and Lebanon can ill afford more debt. The IMF expects its debt-to-GDP ratio, currently about 150%, to hit 180% in five years. By then debt service will burn through three-fifths of government revenue, leaving almost nothing for capital expenditures (already quite low). In May voters went to the polls for a long-delayed parliamentary election. Mr Hariri took a beating, losing 13 seats, 40% of his total. Still, he will probably remain prime minister—if he ever forms a government. Instead of discussing reforms, lawmakers are haggling over cabinet posts, which they use to disperse spoils. With the economy heading for a crash, there may not be much to hand out.

(218, 'Falun Gong still worries China, despite efforts to crush the sect', 'In China the movement sputters on. Abroad its profile grows', 'TUCKED away in a corner on Gerrard Street, in the heart of London’s Chinatown, three middle-aged Chinese women sit on the ground, their legs tightly crossed, in silent meditation. A deafening loudspeaker behind them blasts out a stream of invective against the Chinese Communist Party. Before long, one of them gets up and starts handing out flyers to passers-by. But pedestrians from China who are approached by the woman grimace and dart away. Most do not even bother to glance at the meditators, who are adherents of Falun Gong, a spiritual practice which China banned in 1999 and calls an “evil cult”. Such a brusque response should offer some solace to China’s government, which has been trying for nearly two decades to crush Falun Gong, a movement that once enjoyed widespread mainstream acceptance. The ruthless campaign, however, has significantly weakened, but not destroyed, the sect. Chinese officials still worry about its influence at home. Official lists of proscribed cults still put Falun Gong at the top. But it is the sect’s activities abroad that are an even bigger, and growing, concern for the Communist Party. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. Officials like to tar Falun Gong with the same brush as apocalyptic cults such as America’s Branch Davidians and Aum Shinrikyo in Japan, but it shows no sign of the violent extremes associated with those sects. It is likely that the Chinese government overstates the comparison as a way of undermining the appeal of a movement that it sees not so much as a threat to society, but as a challenge to the party itself. As Carl Minzner of Fordham University puts it in a new book, Falun Gong has become “by far the most organised” among anti-Communist movements within the Chinese diaspora. Chinese dissidents in exile are prone to factious squabbles; they find it very hard to unite. Falun Gong shows little obvious sign of disunity. It is difficult to assess how much of a following Falun Gong retains in China. So brutal has the government’s campaign against it been—including the imprisonment of thousands of Falun Gong followers—that practitioners are extremely wary of proclaiming their beliefs openly. In the 1990s Falun Gong may have had millions of adherents. Some of them were party members and officials. Students and staff met on university campuses to take part in Falun Gong meditation. Massimo Introvigne of the Centre for Studies on New Religions, a think-tank in Italy, says that the current following in China is probably only about 5% of what it was then. Even so, the numbers remain large enough to alarm the government. Every few weeks Chinese-language media report on recent arrests of Falun Gong suspects. In May a woman from the southern province of Guizhou was sentenced to a year in prison for sending pro-Falun Gong messages to more than 2,000 people on WeChat, a social-media platform. In July three women in Beijing were each sentenced to between three and four years in jail for distributing the sect’s literature at a market. Overseas the movement, which has a large unofficial headquarters in hilly woodland in upstate New York, has been expanding its public profile (pictured are followers marching through Washington, DC, in June). In the early 2000s practitioners in America launched multi-language news media such as Epoch Times, a newspaper, and NTD, a television station. These have grown to rival China’s state media in their reach abroad. In 2006 followers created a pro-Falun Gong cultural group called Shen Yun Performing Arts. It has put on shows of traditional Chinese dance and music (spiced up with anti-Communist themes) before capacity audiences at prestigious venues. Next year the troupe is due to perform in 81 cities in four continents. Overseas adherents have also been adept at lobbying Western politicians. In 2009 Canadian legislators set up a bipartisan “Friends of Falun Gong” association. One of China’s biggest anxieties about Falun Gong is that it is led by someone living outside China over whom it has no control: Li Hongzhi, a 67-year-old former government clerk in a grain-procurement office in north-eastern China. Mr Li founded Falun Gong in 1992. It was then no more than a quasi-Buddhist spiritual movement. Adherents would try to gain enlightenment by reading the works of “Master Li” (said to be able to walk through walls) and engaging in slow-motion exercise routines, often in groups in public. Mr Li fled to America a couple of years before the sect was banned, and remains active. In a speech in June to thousands of followers at a stadium in Washington, he praised practitioners in China for keeping their faith despite repression by the “evil” party. It was only in response to the party’s efforts to eradicate it that Falun Gong turned anti-Communist. In April 1999 thousands of followers protested outside Zhongnanhai, the party’s headquarters in Beijing, about the arrest of Falun Gong activists in the nearby port of Tianjin. It was the biggest demonstration in the capital’s heart since the pro-democracy movement of 1989. Although it had no political aim, it spooked the party. Chinese leaders felt threatened by what they saw as a “competing ideology”, says Anastasia Lin, a Canadian human-rights advocate (and winner of the Miss World Canada pageant in 2015) who practises Falun Gong. Three months later China banned the sect. Thereafter, Mr Li began openly attacking the party. Among Chinese diplomats based abroad, monitoring Falun Gong’s activities and combating its influence is treated as an important duty. They put pressure on venues to cancel Shun Yun’s performances (sometimes successfully) and not to allow speeches by Falun Gong adherents. In 2015 Chinese officials denied Ms Lin a visa to take part in a Miss World contest in China. Last year the Chinese embassy in London told a student society at Durham University not to allow her to speak in a public debate (she did anyway). A Falun Gong practitioner in Calgary, Canada, says she believes she has seen Chinese spies try to infiltrate the sect in her city. She says some of them are “pretty conspicuous”, giving themselves away by not knowing the correct posture for meditating. In recent years, from New York to Hong Kong, “anti-cult” stalls have become an increasingly common sight in public places where Falun Gong practitioners gather. They usually have a handful of staff, who distribute anti-Falun Gong literature and display photographs aimed at making adherents look unhinged. Organisers deny that they are agents of the Chinese government, but it is likely that the party encourages their efforts.

(219, 'Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are useless', 'For blockchains, the jury is still out', 'AN OLD saying holds that markets are ruled by either greed or fear. Greed once governed cryptocurrencies. The price of Bitcoin, the best-known, rose from about $900 in December 2016 to $19,000 a year later. Recently, fear has been in charge. Bitcoin’s price has fallen back to around $7,000; the prices of other cryptocurrencies, which followed it on the way up, have collapsed, too. No one knows where prices will go from here. Calling the bottom in a speculative mania is as foolish as calling the top. It is particularly hard with cryptocurrencies because, as our Technology Quarterly this week points out, there is no sensible way to reach any particular valuation. It was not supposed to be this way. Bitcoin, the first and still the most popular cryptocurrency, began life as a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks. A decade on, it is barely used for its intended purpose. Users must wrestle with complicated software and give up all the consumer protections they are used to. Few vendors accept it. Security is poor. Other cryptocurrencies are used even less. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. With few uses to anchor their value, and little in the way of regulation, cryptocurrencies have instead become a focus for speculation. Some people have made fortunes as cryptocurrency prices have zoomed and dived; many early punters have cashed out. Others have lost money. It seems unlikely that this latest boom-bust cycle will be the last. Economists define a currency as something that can be at once a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. Lack of adoption and loads of volatility mean that cryptocurrencies satisfy none of those criteria. That does not mean they are going to go away (though scrutiny from regulators concerned about the fraud and sharp practice that is rife in the industry may dampen excitement in future). But as things stand there is little reason to think that cryptocurrencies will remain more than an overcomplicated, untrustworthy casino. Can blockchains—the underlying technology that powers cryptocurrencies—do better? These are best thought of as an idiosyncratic form of database, in which records are copied among all the system’s users rather than maintained by a central authority, and where entries cannot be altered once written. Proponents believe these features can help solve all sorts of problems, from streamlining bank payments and guaranteeing the provenance of medicines to securing property rights and providing unforgeable identity documents for refugees. Those are big claims. Many are made by cryptocurrency speculators, who hope that stoking excitement around blockchains will boost the value of their related cryptocurrency holdings. Yet firms that deploy blockchains often end up throwing out many of the features that make them distinctive. And shuttling data continuously between users makes them slower than conventional databases. As these limitations become more widely known, the hype is starting to cool. A few organisations, such as SWIFT, a bank-payment network, and Stripe, an online-payments firm, have abandoned blockchain projects, concluding that the costs outweigh the benefits. Most other projects are still experimental, though that does not stop wild claims. Sierra Leone, for instance, was widely reported to have conducted a “blockchain-powered” election earlier this year. It had not. Just because blockchains have been overhyped does not mean they are useless. Their ability to bind their users into an agreed way of working may prove helpful in arenas where there is no central authority, such as international trade. But they are no panacea against the usual dangers of large technology projects: cost, complexity and overcooked expectations. Cryptocurrencies have fallen far short of their ambitious goals. Blockchain advocates have yet to prove that the underlying technology can live up to the grand claims made for it.

(222, 'Rare White Fawn Born in New York City', 'The birth of a rare white deer on Staten Island—on land meant to be a Native American memorial—is a source of inspiration for the community.', 'A mostly white fawn weaves in and out of the trees, her pearly fleece shimmering, ghostlike. Petite and elegant, she inhabits the historic ramparts and sloping greens of Fort Wadsworth, a 226-acre site on Staten Island’s northeastern shore. The location—one of the oldest American fortifications, first built by the Dutch in the 17th Century—is known for being the starting point of the New York City Marathon each November. Her appearance, according to some, serves as an inspiration to begin anew a different quest: A project to honor Native Americans that dates back more than a century. The young deer can be seen grazing and playing at dawn and dusk with its normal-colored twin and their mother in the glow of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge’s lights, just overhead, on land managed by the National Park Service. Gotham’s greenest borough has been trying to give vasectomies to all the bucks in its growing white-tailed deer population for the past three years in a campaign run by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The program—which costs over $3.3 million—is the first of its kind in the nation, according to the New York Times. In 2016, more than 90 percent of the sexually active male deer on the island were sterilized via vasectomy, a simple surgery that prevents males from passing sperm to females. The creature’s coloration is a result of a condition called leucism, which causes a lightening of skin and fur and is found in only one percent of deer. When the white pelt is flecked with the red-brown of normal deer the result is called “piebald.” This coloration is the result of a recessive trait that can also cause skeletal deformities like short or malformed legs, a curved spine, and irregularly-shaped organs, says Doug Adamo, the National Park Service biologist assigned to Fort Wadsworth. Luckily, the fawn appears to be in great shape, all things considered. “Some piebald deer born with mild conditions can live a normal life and survive well into adulthood,” he says; those with severe deformities do not live long and typically do not reach adulthood. The fawn seems resilient in other ways, seemingly unbothered by the cacophony of overhead traffic between Staten Island and Brooklyn. The dozen or so members of her herd are a bit skittish but not entirely uncomfortable around humans that frequent the park. Many Native American tribes consider white animals to carry mystical import, says Margaret Boldeagle, who has Lenape tribe heritage and is a founder of the Red Storm Drum & Dance Troupe on the island. And white deer, especially stags, are mythological stars. King Arthur seeks one that eludes him. Harry Potter summons a silvery white stag to save himself. The Chronicles of Narnia ends when the characters follow a white stag back to their home. And the label of the popular German digestif Jägermeister features a stag with some white fur in an homage to the patron saint of hunters, Saint Hubert, who supposedly converted to Christianity after a mystical encounter with one. The Celts believe it is an emissary from the afterlife, and cultures from Hungary to Scotland to Japan have stories as well. Killing a white deer is illegal in several states, and where it is not illegal there is a folk tradition that it’s very unlucky to do so. There is a sanctuary for them in Seneca County, New York, where more than 70 of the animals run free. “You have a beauty,” says sanctuary director Dennis Money, of the Staten Island fawn. Much more than a genetic anomaly, some Native Americans see the rare animal as an inspiration for renewed work on what is to them sacred ground. Here, Congress had granted land for building the North American Indian Memorial, which was to include a museum and a statue taller than Lady Liberty. In February 1913, President William Howard Taft and 32 chiefs from around the nation went so far as to gather at this spot and broke ground using a stone axe found near the site, a moment that lives on film in the National Archives. Even Cheyenne leader Two Moons and Red Hawk of the Sioux, who both battled General George Armstrong Custer at the Little Bighorn, were present. Boldeagle was stunned to see the animal; for her it’s a “sign from the Creator” to continue her mission. “I have been working very hard to revive the memorial and was about to give up until the arrival of the white fawn,” she says. She named the fawn Naim (after the memorial’s acronym) and held a benefit concert for the effort August 25. Thomas De Lacy, a Native American from Honduras, and a New York City police detective, plans to perform an Eagle Dance for the fawn at Fort Wadsworth during the September Equinox. These rituals honor eagles, which are believed to carry the prayers of the earthbound to heaven, and follow in the tradition of De Lacy’s tribe, a branch of the Mayans known as the Lenca. “The white fawn is a birth, but it is really a rebirth,” De Lacy says. “The time is now for us all to come together and complete this memorial.” The memorial, which was being financed by Philadelphia department store scion Rodman Wanamaker, fell apart after the outbreak of World War I. That war was ignited by the assassination of Austria’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. According to Smithsonian magazine, legend tells that the archduke—an avid hunter—said he felt bad luck would befall him and that he would die young because he had killed a white stag the year before his murder. Staten Island artist Johnny Lohse, who descends from the Iroquois, says the white fawn is a reminder that a promise was made in 1913 which must be respected. “And the National American Indian Memorial should be a source of pride for not only Native Americans, but all Americans and people worldwide.” The memorial could serve as a cultural jewel for Staten Island’s north shore, which is booming with nearly $2 billion in private and public investment. Margaret Boldeagle says that the Native American stone axe that President Taft and the 32 chiefs used in 1913 is still in safekeeping somewhere in the borough. “I hope to use it to break ground again,” she says.

(224, 'How U.S. Clipper Ships Changed World Trade', 'Clipper ships traveled at blistering speeds but conditions on board were brutal, and opium was their most profitable cargo.', 'In their day, they were the fastest ships ever to have been built. They revolutionized global trade, ferrying tea from China and delivering provisions and equipment to the burgeoning settlement of Gold Rush-era San Francisco. Their owners would become some of the richest men in the United States. But as historian Steven Ujifusa shows in his new book, Barons of the Sea, clipper ships also had a dark side: They serviced the opium trade, which left millions of Chinese addicted, and employed brutal, and sometimes dangerous, methods to make their ships sail faster. When National Geographic caught up with Ujifusa in Washington, D.C., he explained how clipper ship owners reconciled their religious backgrounds with the opium trade, how steamships and the railroad eventually rendered clipper ships obsolete, and how a clipper ship with a female navigator held the record for the fastest voyage from New York to San Francisco right up to the 1980s. A historian said of the clipper ships: “Illicit and desperate practices followed close in their wake throughout their existence.” Explain what he meant, and what the Americans’ goal was in producing them. So-called Baltimore clippers, which were built in the Maryland Chesapeake Bay area in the 1810s and 1820s, were used as slave smugglers and privateers. By the 1840s, American merchants doing business in China took these designs and expanded them into China clippers, carrying tea from Canton to New York and, later, Hong Kong. These merchants also used variants of the Baltimore clippers as opium runners, smuggling opium into China, thanks to bribes given to Chinese officials who were there to stop the opium trade but, instead, facilitated it. What’s distinctive about a clipper ship as opposed to other types of vessels? The definition of an American clipper ship is a three-masted, full-rigged ship with square sails on each of her three masts that was built for speed rather than capacity. So the designers of the great clipper ships of the 1840s and 1850s sharpened the bow and stern, creating much hollower lines than before. They were built to carry high-value freight, like tea from China or, during the Gold Rush, dry goods and provisions to California that would fetch very high prices. These ships were also much more loftily rigged than typical merchant ships. This made them very expensive to operate because you needed crews of 50 or 60 men. Shipping barons like Warren Delano and Robert Forbes got rich from the opium trade in China, which left millions addicted or dead. Introduce us to these men and explain how they squared their Protestant morality with what was essentially drug running, and how it eventually led to the Opium War. Several of the men I feature come from a tight-knit group of Yankee families in the Boston and New Bedford area. They didn’t see anything wrong with the opium trade. Robert Bennett Forbes compared the opium trade to nothing worse than dealing in liquor or strong spirits, and Warren Delano wrote that the opium trade was a perfectly honorable, legitimate trade. But when they were living in the foreigners’ colony in Canton in the 1830s, they didn’t actually see its effects on the Chinese population all that much. In 1838, a new governor of Canton Province was tasked by the emperor with showing the foreign devils, as western traders were known, who was boss. This new commissioner demands that the Americans and British hand over 20,000 chests of opium to the Chinese government for destruction. The British and Americans say, “This is our opium; how can you do this?” So the commissioner promptly blockades the Foreigners Colony, in Canton, and the opium is thrown into the Pearl River. The British traders leave, saying, “We’ll be back with force because you just confiscated the Queen’s opium.” On their return, they shell Canton in revenge and Canton is burned. Under the terms of the Treaty of Nanking, the Chinese government is forced pay 21 million pounds sterling as reparations, not just for the seizure of the British opium but also for the costs for the British Royal Navy to sail over there. The treaty also forces open several other ports for Western trade, which allows opium to flow unchecked into the Celestial Kingdom, thus beginning the so-called “Century of Humiliation” for the Chinese. You call the clipper ship builder Donald McKay a “mechanic and craftsman as American hero.” Tell us about him and the “extreme clippers” he built in Boston. He was an immigrant success story. He was born in 1810 in Nova Scotia, the son of an itinerant shipwright and farmer, came to New York, then opened up his own yard in East Boston in the 1840s, becoming a kind of Jacksonian, common-man hero. He once said something to the effect of, “My words and language are rough but my feelings are honest and true.” He began building a series of very successful, very large ships for the California trade. There’s an old naval design rule that the longer the waterline length of a vessel, the faster it can go. So McKay built clippers that were significantly larger than the old China clippers. McKay’s clippers to California grew to almost 300 feet long and The Republic was almost 400 feet long. This represented a tremendous growth in terms of how big these ships got and how fast they went. Clipper ships like these helped build San Francisco into the city we know today. Starting in 1848-1849, there was a huge demand for miner’s supplies —furniture, chairs, tables, provisions, and lots of booze—to be shipped around Cape Horn from the East Coast, to the new city of San Francisco, which grew from a fishing village of 2,000 people to a major metropolis of over 100,000 by the mid-to-late 1850s. This was similar to how Jeff Bezos revolutionized the supply chain for goods from all over the world. The China clippers would bring tea from Canton or Hong Kong to New York, cutting down the typical sailing speed from 160 days to under 100 days. This was truly revolutionary. One of McKay’s clippers reportedly logged 22 knots, a speed that steamships would not reach until the 1890s. Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman is about a ship’s captain who makes a deal with Satan in exchange for speed. The clipper ships had their own version of the legend in “driver captains” like Robert Waterman. Tell us about him and his fatal voyage in Challenge. Robert Waterman had a long history of making record passages from China. While onshore, he was a dandy and a ladies man, but on ships he was an absolute tyrant. In 1851, he was given command of a clipper ship called The Challenge. She was 2,000 tons and had masts well over 200 feet high. His bosses, the Griswold brothers, offered him a $10,000 bonus if he made it to San Francisco in less than 90 days. But Waterman was given the dregs of the waterfront as a crew. Ultimately, there is a near-mutiny, several men are beaten to death or fall from the yard, and the ship sails into San Francisco Harbor after a voyage of 109 days, flying a distress flag. Waterman is tried for murder in San Francisco. This is one of the more violent episodes in the clipper ship era and exposes to the nation and to the world how men and safety were sacrificed for the quickest possible passage to get goods to market first. This was an era before any sort of regulation of conditions on board or of labor. The way crews were recruited was a bit like the Royal Navy with its press gangs. Actually, that’s where the term Shanghaied came from. Captains would often have a hard time getting enough men to crew up these clipper ships, which needed 50 to 60 men to sail efficiently. So, they would send out so-called “crimps” to the brothels and bars of lower Manhattan or Boston and, working in cahoots with the madams and saloonkeepers, drop drugs into the drinks of the patrons, who would then wake up with a splitting headache, a third of their wages gone and on the way to China or San Francisco. [laughs] I was amazed to read that the Flying Cloud’s record of 89 days and 21 hours from New York to San Francisco stood until 1989. Tell us about the various attempts on that record, and what it says about the clipper ships. The Flying Cloud was unique. Not only was she an exceptionally well-built clipper, and arguably McKay’s masterpiece before The Great Republic, but she also had a very good team. She had a very good captain, Captain Josiah Creesy. He had been in the China trade before. He also had a very valuable asset: his wife, Eleanor Creesy, who served as his navigator. She used a new set of charts that allowed the navigator to find the optimal winds and currents to make a quick passage by avoiding the doldrums. Without her, the Flying Cloud would not have made that voyage. And it was not until the late 1980s that the sailing yacht Thursday’s Child broke the record. Some people say that it doesn’t really count because she was a yacht, not a commercial vessel, and that the record under sail still stands. Eventually, clipper ships became what you call “beautiful anachronisms.” Talk about their legacy for the United States, and the sea barons who built them. The end of the clipper ships came about due to the railroads, first across the Panama Isthmus and later across the continental U.S., which made such long-haul voyages by sail less profitable. Also, the rise of long-distance steam ships and the trans-Atlantic cable, which allowed information, especially financial information, to be transmitted almost instantaneously. The Civil War also wreaked havoc on the clipper ship era, when Confederate raiders chased down and sank several clippers. As for the legacy of these ships, even though their era was extremely brief, they still persist in the American imagination. Naval historian Samuel Eliot Morisonsaid that these clipper ships came and went with the finality of the passenger pigeon, but these were our cathedrals of wood, our Parthenons, the most complex structures we had ever built. And they still elicit wonder today. They were built for brutal, laissez faire capitalism, but in terms of their angelic beauty they are peerless. Warren Delano II was one of the most famous of the men who derived their fortunes from owning clipper ships. He and several of his business partners would diversify their China trade fortunes into industries such as the railroads, coal and copper mining, the Trans-Atlantic cable, and real estate. When Warren Delano died in 1898 he bequeathed well over $1 million to each of his children, which would put him on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy men in America at the time. His most famous descendant was his grandson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who, as a successful politician, loved to quote his grandfather’s famous dictum: “In business, never let your right hand know what your left hand is doing.” Many of the great clipper ship fortunes funded famous preparatory schools, like Milton Academy, and universities such as Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, as well as many other well-known cultural institutions. It’s a contradiction that these men were engaged in the opium trade but, when they came home, used their fortunes to invest in early American industries and civic institutions that we still know, and venerate, to this day.

(225, 'Fire Devastates Brazil''s Oldest Science Museum', 'The overnight inferno likely claimed fossils, cultural artifacts, and more irreplaceable collections amassed over 200 years.', 'Major pieces of Brazil''s scientific and cultural heritage went up in smoke on Sunday night, as a devastating fire ripped through much of Rio de Janeiro''s Museu Nacional, or National Museum. Founded in 1818, the museum is Brazil''s oldest scientific institution and one of the largest and most renowned museums in Latin America, amassing a collection of some 20 million scientifically and culturally invaluable artifacts. The Museu Nacional''s holdings include Luzia, an 11,500-year-old skull considered one of South America''s oldest human fossils, as well as the bones of uniquely Brazilian creatures such as the long-necked dinosaur Maxakalisaurus. Because of the auction tastes of Brazil''s 19th-century emperors, the Museu Nacional also ended up with Latin America''s oldest collection of Egyptian mummies and artifacts. Even the building holds historical importance: It housed the exiled Portuguese royal family from 1808 to 1821, after they fled to Rio de Janeiro in 1807 to escape Napoleon. The complex also served as the palace for Brazil''s post-independence emperors until 1889, before the museum collections were transferred there in 1902. In a Monday interview, Federal University of Espírito Santo paleontologist Taissa Rodrigues said that some of the metal cabinets containing fossils may have withstood the fire, though it''s unclear whether the fossils inside survived. Duane Fonseca, a biologist at Brazil''s Federal University of Rio Grande, reported on Twitter on Monday that technicians had saved some of the museum''s more than 40,000 mollusk specimens. But now, many of the fossils, the Egyptian collection, the museum''s invertebrate specimens, and more artifacts housed in the main building are probably destroyed. The museum''s fish and reptile specimens, herbarium, and library were housed separately and are thought to have survived. “When I saw the news about the tragedy, I just started crying, and all my colleagues, other archaeologists I know in Brazil, they had the same reaction—that’s a loss for all the world,” says Maria Ester Franklin Maia Silva, a Brazilian archaeologist and Ph.D. student at the University of São Paulo. It''s not yet clear how the fire started, but it did begin after the museum was closed to the public, and no injuries have yet been reported. Firefighters worked through the night to douse the burnt-out shell of the main building, but it seems the blaze has already seared a gaping hole in many scientists'' careers. “The importance of the collections that were lost couldn''t be overstated,” says Luiz Rocha, a Brazilian ichthyologist now at the California Academy of Sciences who has visited the Museu Nacional several times to study its collections. “They were unique as it gets: Many of them were irreplaceable, there''s no way to put a monetary value on it.” “In terms of [my] life-long research agenda, I''m pretty much lost,” says Marcus Guidoti, a Brazilian entomologist finishing up his Ph.D. in a program co-run by Brazil''s Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. Guidoti studies lace bugs, an insect family with more than 2,000 species worldwide. The Museu Nacional held one of the world''s largest lace bug collections, but the fire likely destroyed it and the rest of the museum''s five million arthropod specimens. “Those type specimens can''t be replaced, and they are crucial to understand the species,” he says by text message. “If I was willing to keep working on this family in this region of the globe, this was definitely a big hit.” Paleontologist Dimila Mothé, a postdoctoral researcher at the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, adds that the blows to science extend beyond the collections themselves. “It''s not only the cultural history, the natural history, but all the theses and research developed there,” she says. “Most of the laboratories there were lost, too, and the research of several professors. I''m not sure you can say the impact of what was lost.” Brazil’s indigenous knowledge also has suffered. The Museu Nacional housed world-renowned collections of indigenous objects, as well as many audio recordings of indigenous languages from all over Brazil. Some of these recordings, now lost, were of languages that are no longer spoken. “I have no words to say how horrible this is,” says Brazilian anthropologist Mariana Françozo, an expert on South American indigenous objects at Leiden University. “The indigenous collections are a tremendous loss…we can no longer study them, we can no longer understand what our ancestors did. It’s heartbreaking.” On Monday, The Brazilian publication G1 Rio reported that ashes of burned documents—some still flecked in notes or illustrations—have rained down from the sky more than a mile away from the Museu Nacional, thrown aloft by the inferno. This is not the first time in recent years that the world lost a natural history museum. In April 2016, India''s National Museum of Natural History in New Delhi was also destroyed in a fire. Nor is this the first time that fire has claimed an invaluable part of Brazil''s heritage. In 2010, blazes ripped through the Instituto Butantan, a major biomedical research laboratory in São Paulo, destroying one of the world''s largest collections of venomous animal specimens. The fire vaporized more than half a million preserved snakes, spiders, and scorpions collected over a hundred years. “This is far from being a problem unique to Brazil," says the paleontologist Rodrigues. “Collections worldwide are at risk, and unless we take good care of them, these kinds of things will happen again and again and again.” In a statement posted on Twitter, Brazilian president Michael Temer lamented the Museu Nacional''s loss as “incalculable to Brazil” and “a sad day for all Brazilians.” But the Brazilian government is facing mounting criticism over complaints that the tragedy was preventable. Since 2014, the Museu Nacional hasn''t received its full annual $128,000 maintenance budget; this year, it received a paltry $13,000. In 2015, the Museu Nacional was forced to close its doors temporarily because it could no longer pay its cleaning and security staff. The museum''s curators had to crowdfund repairs to termite damage in one of the most popular exhibit halls, which contained the skeleton of a humpback whale and bones from the dinosaur Maxakalisaurus. A full-size replica of the dinosaur Maxakalisaurus topai is seen on display at the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2006. In May 2018—on the eve of its 200th anniversary—ten of the museum''s 30 exhibits were closed to the public because of disrepair. At the time, the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported that the museum had peeling walls and exposed electrical wiring. When the fire broke out on Sunday, the two fire hydrants near the musem were reportedly empty, forcing firefighters to use water trucks and pond water from Quinta da Boa Vista, the urban park containing the Museu Nacional. “In my point of view, Brazil had responsibility to keep these artifacts safe, [and] Brazil failed on that,” says Franklin Maia Silva. Already, the Brazilian government has pledged that it will start studying how to rebuild the Museu Nacional. Folha de S.Paulo also reports that culture minister Sérgio Sá Leitão has called for inspections of other Brazilian museums'' fire protection systems. But researchers point out that simply fixing the building will do little to fill the gaping hole in Brazilian science, especially as the country continues to slash research budgets. In March 2017, Temer cut science funding by 44 percent, to $1 billion—the lowest levels since 2005—and in late 2017, he proposed further cuts of another 16 percent. Some of the country''s research institutions have struggled to pay for basic amenities such as electricity bills, reports Nature. “Science in general in Brazil is seen as something we don''t need to invest in,” says Rocha. “I hope [Brazilian leaders] open their eyes and see that it''s worth investing in, besides rebuilding.” “First, there’s disbelief that they will really fund the reincorporation of the museum, and [my] second reaction is anger, because they knew the museum needed funding for years,” Françozo adds. “How do you ‘rebuild’ a 200-year-old collection that has burned to ashes?” In the meantime, local students are working on a rebuilding project of their own: “In the face of tonight''s tragedy, the students of the museology course at UNIRIO [the Federal University for the State of Rio de Janeiro] are mobilizing to preserve the memory of the National Museum,” the Museu Nacional said in an email. “We ask everyone who possesses images (photographs/videos/even selfies) of the collection and exhibition spaces to share them with us.” The students may well get a submission from Emilio Bruna, an ecologist at the University of Florida. Bruna''s work often takes him to Brazil, where he studies habitat fragmentation. But when he recently visited the Museu Nacional with his wife—a native Brazilian—and their children, the family strolled the halls as tourists. “You walk through this building that was there at the origins of this incredibly rich and vibrant country, you saw people proud to see the fossils of Brazilian dinosaurs—of animals unique to their country. As soon as I found out [about the fire] and blurted it out, my son was in tears. He was just devastated,” Bruna says. “Museums are living, breathing repositories of who we are and where we’ve come from, and the world around us,” he adds. “Those insects pinned in a drawer, or those fish in a jar, or a feathered cape you might see in a display case—that represents a little piece of who we are as a people, as humans, as part of a greater world. “And when those specimens are lost, we lose some of who we are.” ', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/09/news-museu-nacional-fire-rio-de-janeiro-natural-history.html', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/science/2018/09/05/brazil-museum-fire/rio-national-museum-fire.jpg', '2018-09-05T07:00:54.3442289Z', 213, 3),
(226, 'How South Asian Americans Are Building a New American Dream', 'They''re expanding on the success of their immigrant parents, creating a blended cultural identity—and turning the tables on old stereotypes.', 'The stand-up comic Hari Kondabolu, who is Indian American, had just finished telling a joke about being brown in America when the laughter was interrupted. “Thank you, come again!” a heckler yelled mockingly in a thick, faux Indian accent. The phrase is instantly recognizable to millions of fans of The Simpsons television show as the signature utterance of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, who is portrayed unabashedly as a racial stereotype: the thrifty, borderline unscrupulous, and somewhat servile Indian convenience store owner. To Kondabolu, those words at a show in October 2015 were even more familiar. Like many people of South Asian heritage in the United States, Kondabolu had “Thank you, come again!” aimed at him countless times while growing up. Now his irritation found expression in a smiling comeback. “I know you from high school, even though I don’t,” he said, pointing at the heckler. “You are the reason I do comedy, sir.” Kondabolu, 35, has a boyish appearance, with a mop of wavy, dark hair on top of a chubby face that seems to bear a perpetual expression of mild amusement. His friendliness belies the scathing quality of his humor. “Knowing that the accent was used to mock us made me very apprehensive to have people meet my family,” Kondabolu told me about his adolescent years, when I met him and his immigrant parents, Ravi and Uma, in Queens, New York. His response was to find a comedic voice of his own to skewer the often cartoonish, one-dimensional portrayal of brown people in American media and popular culture. One of his early jokes was a riff on a caption he says he read on a picture of the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which is part of the British crown jewels, describing the precious stone as having been found in India in the mid-1800s. “Right. It was just found in India. It wasn’t taken from India. It was just found there,” he says, because Indians didn’t know what diamonds were and were “grinding them up, putting them into curry,” and making “diamond biryani” until “luckily the British showed up.” Another joke was about how his mother would pretend to call adoption services whenever he and his brother were being troublesome. “One day we discovered there was nobody on the other end of the phone, and so the next time she said it, I told her I would be calling immigration, and that ended that.” It was satisfying to Kondabolu that he could reference the same racial tropes that irked him to challenge stereotypes. “When you get to a place where you are telling your own stories, that’s huge,” he said. “That’s control.” Kondabolu brought his journey as a satirist full circle with his documentary film, The Problem With Apu, which opens with a clip of his response to the heckler. The film argues that the character is racist. Kondabolu finds it ridiculous that one of the most visible representations of Indian Americans on TV is a caricature voiced by “a white guy doing an impression of a white guy making fun of my father.” (The Simpsons appears on Fox TV, which is owned by 21st Century Fox, the majority owner of National Geographic Partners.) Kondabolu is one of many second-generation South Asian Americans, predominantly of Indian heritage, who have gained prominence in mainstream American comedy in the past few years. Their success represents a significant milestone in the integration of people of South Asian descent into American society. By mining their immigrant experience for laughs, Kondabolu and others are giving expression to a self-assurance that many first-generation immigrants did not have. The increased visibility of South Asian Americans in popular culture mirrors the rise of this relatively new immigrant group in various walks of American life—in science, medicine, technology, business—and now increasingly in politics and public service, as exemplified by Ravi S. Bhalla, the new mayor of the largely white city of Hoboken, New Jersey, who, like many Sikh men, wears a turban. In recent years South Asians have been one of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the United States, increasing in population from 2.2 million in 2000 to 4.9 million in 2015. About 80 percent of the demographic is Indian, with a median annual household income of $100,000—nearly double the median for all U.S. households. Even though some communities with roots in South Asian countries, like Bangladeshis and Nepalis, are generally far less affluent, the overall success of South Asian Americans is no mystery. It can be partly explained by U.S. policy, which since the 1960s has selectively encouraged educated foreign workers and high-performing students to immigrate. Owing to its large English-speaking population, a result of British colonialism, and the quality of some of its educational institutions, India became a major source of such talent. And family-based immigration opened the doors to a broad array of South Asians. Second-generation South Asians are building on that success, with many such as Kondabolu venturing outside career paths typically favored by their immigrant parents. As they find their place in the nation’s ever changing tapestry, they are forming a cultural identity that blends values and traditions they inherited into a new way of being American. “When you are the child of an immigrant and you are running for office, or you are a journalist telling a story, or you are an actor-performer who has a platform to speak, this is all new, but it’s examples of us saying, ‘Hey, we are valid,’” Kondabolu told me. “‘Hey, see our stories? They aren’t stories of foreigners. They are the stories of people here in America.’” When I set out to write this piece, I had more than a journalistic interest in second-generation South Asians. I am an Indian immigrant, having arrived in 1999 to go to graduate school, where I met my future wife, who grew up in the U.S. I still hum Bollywood songs and habitually surf Indian news sites, but I have a deep sense of belonging to America. Our two children were born here, and last year I became a U.S. citizen. Learning about the lives of second-generation South Asians, I hoped, would help me imagine my children’s future. Many second-generation South Asians were born to highly educated immigrant parents and have had a privileged upbringing, like that of Subash Bazaz, a 47-year-old cardiologist. On a recent Sunday morning, I went to Great Falls, Virginia, to meet his family. I took off my shoes at the door, as is customary in many Indian homes, and was greeted by three generations: Bazaz; his parents, Bansi and Veena, who immigrated from India in 1970; and his 16-year-old son, Abhishek. Bansi Bazaz, an 80-year-old retired doctor of internal medicine with large eyes and a slight frame, was visiting for a weekly ritual: driving with his grandson to his class in tabla, a pair of traditional drums played by hand. The contrast between the lives of grandfather, son, and grandson offers a glimpse into how being South Asian in America has evolved since the first big wave of immigrants began arriving in the 1960s, when long-standing barriers to immigration from Asia were removed. Bansi was part of that wave—one of many South Asian doctors who immigrated. “It was a gold rush,” said Bansi, who grew up in Kashmir and studied medicine in Bangalore. He took a job in Ogdensburg, New York, a town with fewer than 15,000 residents then. “What the white doctors didn’t want to do—those were the only jobs that were open.” It was there that his son, Subash Bazaz, a mild-mannered man with a soothing voice, grew up. “There was a very small Indian community, mostly made up of other doctors like my dad,” he recalled. The families mainly socialized with each other. His parents, like many immigrant parents, wanted him to stay focused on academics. “We couldn’t go out all the time, couldn’t have sleepovers. Dating was really frowned upon,” Bazaz said. “The Indian background did put barriers between myself and my white peers.” At school he did his best to avoid drawing attention to his Indian heritage, never bringing lunch from home because the spicy aroma would have made him stand out. Although Bazaz went through a phase of trying to shed his Indian identity—“I didn’t want to be seen clinging to other Indian folks”—by the time he finished college, his closest friends were Indian Americans. This arc of shunning and then embracing one’s heritage is a familiar theme in the lives of many second-generation immigrants. As an immigrant doctor, Bazaz’s father told me, he had to fight for fair treatment and equal opportunity. By contrast, Bazaz says he faced no perceptible barriers. When he entered the profession, doctors of Indian ancestry were more the norm than a novelty. He had the option of pursuing opportunities in cities big and small and joined a practice in the Washington, D.C., area with three Indian-American cardiologists. After Abhishek consumed the omelet made by his mother, Sameera, who is of Indian descent, I went with him to the house of his tabla instructor. “Playing the tabla is one way for me to appreciate Indian culture,” said Abhishek, who rarely listens to Indian music. He and his grandfather both commented on how different it is growing up Indian American now because of the large South Asian population in some cities. That was in evidence at the instructor’s house, where one batch of students—all of Indian heritage—was leaving as Abhishek, a broad-shouldered boy with a shy smile, sat down cross-legged with seven other boys. As he tapped fast and furiously on his tabla, Abhishek’s fingers became a blur. Some second-generation South Asians grew up in less fortunate circumstances than Bazaz and Kondabolu. They were raised by parents who slaved away in physically demanding blue-collar jobs that more often than not were low paying. Notably many Indians from the state of Gujarat bought and ran budget motels. South Asians without money or advanced education washed dishes, stocked shelves at grocery stories, and drove taxis, which is what Tanzina Ahmed’s father did. (Click here to read about how Indian Americans came to own half of U.S. motels.) When Ahmed came to New York City from Bangladesh in 1990 as a five-year-old, she barely spoke English. The language barrier made it difficult to make friends at school. Despite her struggles or perhaps because of them, Ahmed excelled in school. She got impressive results on the SAT, including a perfect score in the verbal section. Ahmed’s family, however, had arrived as undocumented immigrants, and she discovered this made her ineligible for most scholarships and financial-aid programs. “It was like having a window you think is open for you just a crack slammed on your face,” she said. Ahmed, who has sparkling eyes and a sardonic wit, subsequently discovered a rare scholarship program—at the City University of New York—that wasn’t closed to undocumented students. She received a full merit scholarship to CUNY’s Macaulay Honors College. Her parents were eager to see her on a path to citizenship. The only solution they could think of was to arrange a marriage to a U.S. citizen, and so, while Ahmed was pursuing a doctorate in psychology, she married a Bangladeshi-American man found by her parents. Their marriage ran into trouble but lasted long enough for her to get citizenship. The Indian population’s average annual earnings of $75,000 exceed the U.S. average of $46,000, largely due to high-paying science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers. Fewer than 8 percent of Indians in America live below the poverty line, compared with 13.5 percent of the U.S. population. Only 17 percent of Indians age 25 or over don’t have a degree beyond a high school diploma or GED certificate, compared with 41 percent of the U.S. population in the same age group. Forty percent of Indians age 25 or over have degrees higher than a bachelor’s, compared with 11 percent for the U.S. population age 25 or over. Indian-born college grads in the U.S. have degrees or jobs in STEM or the social sciences. Half of all U.S.-born college grads have degrees or jobs in these fields. This is the only category shown where the figure for Indians in America nearly matches the national average. Ahmed, who has taught at Bronx Community College, is now remarried—to a Malaysian-Chinese American she met through mutual friends. Over the past few years, she said, “I have grown so much more comfortable with my identity as a Bengali-American, Muslim woman.” For much of her life, she says, she resented her Bengali roots—first because of bullying and harassment at school and later when her parents found her a match. After her divorce the resentment began fading away. “I realized that there are parts of my identity and this cultural background that I’m really proud of,” she said. “I like the fact that we come together as a family, and we choose to live near each other and help each other out a lot. I like the fact that we don’t endorse things like going on Tinder and dating five million people.” A defining characteristic of many South Asians—and Asians generally—is a keen aspiration for career success. The pressure to do well at school is a common theme, reflected in the prevalence of South Asian kids participating in—and winning—spelling bees and competitions in science and math. Their parents are more inclined to nudge them toward professions such as medicine and law, but increasingly second-generation South Asians are following their hearts. Kondabolu, too, felt that pressure to walk a familiar path. When he was trying out comedy in school and in college, his parents hoped it was just a phase. “They said, ‘Don’t let it interfere with your studies,’ which it did,” he said. After college Kondabolu wanted to pursue stand-up, but his mother wanted him to go to graduate school. At the time he felt angry. “I remember thinking, All these white kids get support—‘Yeah, be what you want to be’—and I couldn’t get that support.” Kondabolu moved to Seattle to work as an activist for immigrant rights and did stand-up in the evenings. He got noticed. After appearing at an HBO comedy festival and on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, he felt ready to dive headlong into comedy. But when he was accepted at the London School of Economics to do a master’s in human rights, his mother, a tall, poised woman who trained as a doctor, wanted him to go. “I had a career that had just started,” he said. “And my mom said, ‘You’ve got to do the master’s.’” Kondabolu got the degree but began doing comedy full-time after returning to New York City. “In six months I wanted to quit,” he told me. “I was like, What am I doing? I have a master’s degree. My classmates are working at the UN, the World Bank, UNICEF, and I am telling jokes in the basement of a bar that takes me two hours to get to and two hours to get back?” But his parents, reassured he had a fallback, encouraged him. Kondabolu kept at it, and success followed. The material that he and fellow South Asian comics present has found a diverse and growing audience over the past decade. “Because our stories were suppressed for so long, everything is new and exciting and interesting,” Kondabolu said. In the early years he used a thick Indian accent in some of his comedy—like the bit about his mother calling adoption services—but later dropped it, feeling that it detracted from his desire to tell jokes from “a place of empowerment and not of self-deprecation.” With his documentary Kondabolu has arguably started one of the most important public discussions about South Asians in America. After airing on cable in November, The Problem With Apu sparked a debate between those who agree with his criticisms and others who feel he’s being overly sensitive. His parents, Uma and Ravi, were never bothered by Apu in the way that Kondabolu was, a divergence attributable perhaps to how differently the generations view their place in American society. “When we came, we knew we were entering a foreign place,” Uma told me. “This country doesn’t owe us anything.” Kondabolu, on the other hand, took for granted that he was entitled to a voice in America. “I believe that this isn’t about me turning into you,” he said. “This is about us sharing and coming up with something different. That’s what America is—it’s about changing with every new idea and person that comes here.” For some South Asians, parental expectations go beyond achieving high levels of professional success. They also can come under pressure to conform to cultural traditions. That can mean running into opposition within the family when deciding to marry outside one’s religion, caste, or race—an experience that Ambar Zobairi faced. A 44-year-old Pakistani-American woman who grew up in Carbondale, Illinois, Zobairi works at the International Foundation for Electoral Systems in Washington, D.C. She has spent more than a decade helping to increase public participation in elections and governance throughout the Middle East and North Africa. In countries such as Lebanon and Libya, Zobairi, who has deep-set eyes that convey warmth, has focused on empowering women. Twenty-five years ago Zobairi had to fight her own battle to be with the man she loved. In 1993, three months after she had begun dating a white American college classmate named Mark Henderson, her father, Riazuddin, then a professor of religious history at Southern Illinois University, gave her an audiocassette. As she listened to it in her room, tears streamed down her face. “He said how much he loved me and that he knew that I must be in love. He expressed that he always wanted me to be happy but that he really wished for me to be with somebody who was Muslim,” Zobairi recalled. She said her father also worried he would lose his standing in Carbondale’s conservative Pakistani community. Despite her emotional turmoil, Zobairi was steadfast. She had strong, independent-minded women in her family to take inspiration from, most notably her mother, a Pakistani Christian, who had married Zobairi’s father over the objections of her family. “I always knew that if there was a path I needed to take, even if it was going to be difficult, I was going to continue on that path,” she said. Zobairi stopped meeting with Henderson in public, but they kept the relationship going through phone calls and letters. Her life at home went on as usual, although tensions remained in the background. Henderson—worried about the possible estrangement between Zobairi and her father—eventually told her father he would embrace Islam. Reciting a one-sentence testimony of faith at the Islamic Center of Carbondale, he became a Muslim. In the summer of 1997, Zobairi and Henderson married. During the weekday rush hour, while riding a train in the San Francisco Bay Area, I found myself in a sea of brown faces. It was a reminder of the immense presence of people of South Asian origin—more specifically, of Indian origin—working in Silicon Valley, many of whom entered the country under the H-1B visa program to fill a shortage of technology workers. Not only do Indian immigrants and second-generation Indian Americans constitute a significant slice of the U.S. tech workforce, but they also lead major companies such as Google and Microsoft. For a close-up of life inside this prosperous enclave, I visited Nirav Tolia, the 46-year-old co-founder of Nextdoor, a social-networking service for neighborhoods that recently was valued at more than one billion dollars. Tolia is trim, with a youthful face that has no hint of facial hair. The son of Indian immigrants who are both doctors, he grew up on a cul-de-sac in a predominantly white neighborhood in Odessa, Texas, where neighbors would give him rides to school, babysit him, and watch him when his parents were traveling. They invited him to swim in their pools and play tennis on their courts. “We’d come back from visiting relatives in India, and I’d literally want to kiss the ground,” Tolia told me. The memory of that warm and nurturing community is what inspired Tolia—along with six partners, including another Indian American—to found Nextdoor. Launched seven years ago, it enables users to connect with neighbors and share information useful to the community, from car break-ins to used-toy giveaways. Tolia describes it as an online tool for strengthening bonds between neighbors—bonds that have frayed all over the world. Tolia started out at Yahoo!, where many of his colleagues, including his boss, were of Indian ancestry. He was also being mentored and supported by the Indus Entrepreneurs, a South Asian networking nonprofit with thousands of members in more than a dozen countries, which helped him when he co-founded his first start-up, Epinions, a consumer review site. “Not only is my race and identity not holding me back, but I’m in a place where some of the most successful people in the industry are my race,” he said. After Epinions merged with another company and went public, Tolia made a fortune, but not without controversy. He resigned from the new company in 2004 after it was discovered that he had misrepresented his degree and experience on his résumé. He was also sued by some of his former partners, who had made nothing on the deal, resulting in an undisclosed settlement. On a recent afternoon Tolia and his wife, Megha, an Indian American who went to Harvard Business School and is now a vice president at Method, which makes environmentally friendly cleaning products, gave me a tour of their home—an elegant, 8,000-square-foot, five-level modern mansion. While showing me the master bedroom, which opens out to a large terrace with a breathtaking view of San Francisco Bay, Tolia heard the second of their three sons, four-year-old Dylan, stirring awake from his nap. Dylan was still under the covers, yawning, when we entered his room. Tolia had told me earlier that he and his wife were raising their boys in a way that “blends the best of multiple cultures.” When Dylan jumped out of bed, Tolia asked if he would sing a Sanskrit prayer for me. Dylan sang Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger” instead. A little later, when asked again, he happily obliged. “Twameva mata cha pita twameva, twameva bandhush-cha sakha twameva,” he sang. The words, addressed to an eternal and universal God, loosely translate to “For you indeed are my mother, my father; you are my kin, my friend.” ', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/09/south-asian-american-stereotype-kondabolu-simpsons.html', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/magazine/rights-exempt/2018/09/south-asian-american/south-asian-americans-new-dream-11.jpg', '2018-09-05T07:00:54.3129815Z', 218, 3);

(227, 'Baby Giant Mekong Catfish are Hard to Find', 'A new study gathers clues—in the form of fish fry—to plummeting numbers of humongous catfish in the legendary Mekong river system.', 'Dark morning clouds hang over Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, as Zeb Hogan readies to head out on the muddy Mekong on a different kind of mission. Usually when the University of Nevada, Reno fish biologist—and host of the Nat Geo Wild TV show “Monster Fish”—goes out on the river, he’s in search of aquatic giants. This time he has his sights set on much smaller quarry: the billions—or more likely trillions—of microscopic fish that are swept down the Mekong River during the monsoon season. Some of them are in steep decline, and Hogan wants to help scientists find out why. What could be one of the most mysterious and least-studied mass movement of river fish in the world begins hundreds of miles upstream, in the deep pools and rugged river stretches of Laos and northern Cambodia, where soon after the rains set in, all kinds of different fish begin to spawn. As the Mekong transforms into a rushing, sediment-filled monster, it sends massive numbers of larvae and baby fish with it downstream. Moving unseen in the dark and mud, the tiny fish disperse with the floodwaters that spread over large parts of Cambodia and Vietnam. Over time, a fraction of them will survive to grow into full-size edible fish, powering what is the largest inland fishery in the world with a quarter of global freshwater catches. “This dispersal of baby fish underpins one of the most vibrant ecosystems on Earth,” says Hogan, who leads a USAID research project called Wonders of the Mekong. “Without this natural phenomenon, this incredibly productive harvest of the Mekong River would not be possible.” Amid worrying signs that the numbers of certain types of fish, including striped catfish and Mekong giant catfish, are declining dramatically, Hogan is studying and documenting the dispersal together with Thach Phanara, head of laboratories at Cambodia’s Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute, who has been collecting samples of the tiny fish since 2000. This morning, they set off from Caong Caaoy, a small fishing settlement on the edge of Phnom Penh whose residents live in floating houses that have been pushed up against a concrete wall by the rising river. From here it is a short skip out on the Mekong to where a net has been laid to catch the baby fish. The site is close to where the Tonle Sap River connects with the Mekong, and where a strange hydrological event occurs. For most of the year, the Tonle Sap runs south. But during the summer rains, floodwaters from the Mekong push up the Tonle Sap, reversing its course, something only a handful of rivers worldwide do. Some of the tiny fish travel up the Tonle Sap and into Tonle Sap Lake, Southeast Asia’s largest, while others continue down the Mekong. “This is the best place to collect the fish before they go in different directions,” says Phanara. The Mekong River has more than 300 species of fish living in it, but not all of them are thriving. Scientists head into the river to see what juvenile fish they can find, including the legenary giant Mekong catfish. To catch them, the researchers use a bongo net, a cone-shaped net with a square-meter-wide opening that is only allowed for scientific purposes. It has a mesh so fine that it catches everything that floats into it. With the help of a fisherman, Phanara pulls in the net, which has been sitting 20 feet down at the bottom of the turbid river. Collected in a cannister tied to the end of the net is a primordial soup of liquid life. But it is not until the contents are emptied onto a large tray that the researchers can see what it contains: hundreds of minuscule fish—some juveniles a centimeter or two long, others little more than a speck. It may seem like a good haul, especially since the net has only been in the water for half an hour. But it is nothing compared to the numbers collected during peaks in the flood pulse, when a catch may contain as many as a million baby fish. Such peaks usually occur—for reasons scientists are not sure about—for a day or two a few times a season. But this summer, no peak has been observed. “I’m very curious to find out why that is,” says Phanara. The diversity of fish being caught is still impressive. “There must be at least 20 different kinds of fish here,” says Hogan, as Phanara confidently identifies species after species of fish that to the untrained eye look like little more than goo. In all, more than 330 fish species have been caught in Phanara’s bongo net at this single site, an astonishing number, even considering that the Mekong River basin has the second-highest biodiversity of any river in the world, after the Amazon. Samples are taken to a laboratory for further identification and analysis, a painstaking process that can take half a day for one specimen. Under the microscope, the strange features of many of the tiny fish—with all manners of mouths, bug eyes, and long whiskers—come into sharper view. Of particular concern to the researchers is the striped catfish, a large-bodied, migratory fish that spawns somewhere in the upper ranges of Cambodia and was once abundant throughout the lower Mekong River basin. Decades of overharvesting of the fish, including eggs and fry, may have caused catches in some areas to plummet by as much as 99 percent. In 2011, the striped catfish was listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In the catch this morning, the researchers find only a single river catfish specimen, smaller than a pea. Other catfish species are even rarer. So far this year, not a single specimen has been found of the critically endangered Mekong giant catfish, the record-holder for world’s largest freshwater fish at 646 pounds (293 kilos). “The decline of Mekong giant catfish young may mean that spawning adults are now so rare that they have trouble finding each other to spawn,” says Hogan. “Or it could signal a disruption of environmental cues or migration pathways necessary for reproduction. Either way, without juvenile fish, you can’t get adults, let alone record breakers.” While it is extremely difficult to determine the exact numbers of tiny fish dispersing downstream—with little work having been done on the subject—a downward trend likely started several decades ago with fish fry being targeted directly. In the early 1980s, Vietnamese fishers operating in Cambodia began collecting fry of the striped catfish, known locally as trey pra, using bag nets of mosquito netting. The practice was outlawed in Cambodia in 1994, but continued illegally for years. A study done in the late 1990s of the fry fishery in the Mekong River showed that that annual catch of trey pra fry declined by more than 85 percent between 1994 and 1997, from 355 tons to 43 tons. Although fishers no longer target the fry, with extremely fine-mesh nets banned, the volume of larvae and baby fish moving downstream appears to have continued to decline. Since he began collecting samples 18 years ago, Phanara believes—based in part on data provided by the Mekong River Commission for the last couple of years—that his bongo net catch has gone down by 60 to 70 percent, and even more when it comes to the catfish species. “It’s clear that there is a very big problem,” he says. Hogan believes several factors may be at play, including overharvesting of broodstock, habitat fragmentation caused in part by new dams blocking passage for migrating fish, and possibly climate change, which could be disrupting the dispersal peaks. “We know that only a small percentage of the baby fish will survive, so it’s very troubling if the density is declining as much as we fear it is,” says Hogan. “It threatens the existence of the river catfish fishery that was once one of the most productive in Cambodia and the food that was a Cambodian staple.” As part of the project, Hogan and his team also collect live larvae and juveniles of endangered fish for conservation purposes, stocking them in ponds at a research station outside Phnom Penh. There, the young fish are studied for growth and reared to be released back into protected watersheds. The first such release took place on Cambodia’s National Fish Day on July 1, when hundreds of people gathered near the temples of Angkor Wat to observe the release of a wide variety of fish back into the rivers. There are now plans to make the release of the endangered catfish an annual event, and next year Hogan hopes to be able to put one special fish back into the wild: a Mekong giant catfish reared from the one baby specimen that the researchers found of the species during last year’s dispersal down the Mekong. So far, the fish, which has been named “Wonder,” has grown to be a foot long; if it survives to adulthood, it could grow another 8 feet.

(228, 'See Wild Dogs and Hyenas Face Off Over a Kill', 'This epic grudge highlights tense relations between packs and clans struggling to survive in shrinking habitat.', 'Shortly after sunrise on a grey August morning, a pack of wild dogs is on the hunt in South Africa’s Sabi Sand Game Reserve. One dog splits off from the pack and takes down an impala. It leaves its prize unattended to call the rest of pack back to the kill site. It’s time to eat. But as the wild dog leaves the scene, its face splattered with blood, a hyena slinks out of the brush and digs in to the dog’s meal. Soon the wild dog reappears with its pack. They chase the hyena off and begin their family-style feast. It’s not long before the lone hyena returns, this time with backup: at least five more hyenas. This wild game is a struggle for survival. Who will get to eat? Hyenas and wild dogs are top predators competing in an unforgiving landscape. It’s a classic battle that plays out over and over again in the African bush where these animals compete for the same food resources. (Watch wild dogs try to steal a cheetah''s meal.) Roddy Watson, a visitor on safari at a private game lodge called Londolozi, caught the rare moment on video. To watch it is to witness a “primeval interaction”,” says Markus Hofmeyr, chief conservation officer and veterinarian at Great Plains Conservation Foundation in Botswana. “It’s the whole wild ecosystem in full play.” Both apex predators on the African landscape, wild dogs and hyenas are alike and different in surprising ways. Spotted coats give the two species a similar appearance, but a spotted hyena can outweigh an African wild dog by a hundred pounds. What’s more, hyenas are more closely related to cats than to canines. The two species also have different reputations. Wild dogs are endangered, while hyenas have been vilified by popular culture as thieves. Both are efficient hunters, but while wild dogs are known to be very successful hunters and rarely scavenge, hyenas are dedicated scavengers and can get by without hunting if they have to. According to Hofmeyr, hyenas often use their size and numbers to drive off other predators—including lions, leopards, and cheetahs—from whatever they’ve killed, while wild dogs generally don’t. (See the weird way wild dogs use sneezes to communicate.) “When it comes to hyenas and wild dogs,” says veteran game ranger and zoologist James Tyrell, “it is hard to predict which species will come out on top. It’s almost like watching a tense sporting match.” In many areas where hyenas and wild dogs have been reintroduced, he says they seem to coexist well, as long as there’s enough to eat. A dwindling supply of prey might force both species to adapt to a larger landscape, perhaps expanding into human territory outside of protected parks. In this case, hyenas, because they’re primarily nocturnal, have the advantage of hunting under cover. But, like wild dogs, they are often persecuted aggressively for killing livestock. (Busting myths about hyenas: Are they really hermaphrodites?) “It’s that evolutionary niche hyenas have slipped into that they can both steal the prey and kill their own, which makes them so successful,” Hofmeyr says. Hyenas’ strength is another advantage. Unlike wild dogs, a hyena can break out of a snare. In groups, hyenas have been known to kill lions. But it’s not just their brawn that has contributed to hyenas’ success as a species. They’ve also got brains. “Hyenas, certainly underrated and vilified, are incredibly intelligent and adaptable, affectionate and devoted parents and work as a clan to protect each other,” Hofmeyr says. They are highly complex and social animals, not mere thieves. (See what really happened in an apparent conflict between hyenas and a lion.) In the wild, a kill is fair game. In the video, one hyena makes an attempt to snag a piece, but the dogs rebuff their rival with toothy strikes and agitated clucking and chirping vocalizations. Still, the hyenas persist. More arrive. With a chorus of high-pitched whines and cackles, the clan approaches, forming an “intimidating wedge,” Tyrell says. The hyenas rush in, drive off the wild dog pack from their hard-won kill and claim victory. They immediately remove the quarry from the noisy scene. As for watching these remarkable predators fight to survive in the wild, Hofmeyr says, “it’s an absolute privilege.” ', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/09/hyena-versus-wild-dog-scavenging-video-animals.html', 'https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/422/895/smpost_1535483855832.jpg', '2018-09-05T07:00:35.3130289Z', 254, 3),
(229, 'Photos Reveal Turkey’s Lonely Landscapes', 'A photographer documents the country''s changing tourism industry.', 'Turkey’s Cappadocia is known for whimsical images of flocks of hot air balloons rising over a landscape—a scene that looks as though it would be at home in a Salvador Dalí painting. But when Australian photographer Patricia Sofra made her way to the longstanding tourism hub and UNESCO World Heritage site in central Turkey in September 2017, she found a lonelier picture than she envisioned: A single balloon hanging over a swirling landscape of ridges and gullies below. While deflating, a balloon''s pastel fabric mimics the chimneys dotting the landscape of Cappadocia. “It was completely deserted when I went, because tourism had just come to a complete standstill,” Sofra says. “I thought the sky would be full of balloons, and it turned out we were the only balloon up there.” She remembers the surreal moment as they glided through the air—the tour group members began taking selfies, and the guide looked down at the nearly empty sky and began to cry. Turkey’s tourism industry has recently been bouncing back after a major drop-off two years ago spurred by security and political concerns. The falling Turkish lira has helped the recovery, making the country an increasingly attractive destination to budget-conscious tourists and as a shopping destination. But it remains to be seen if the recovery will continue or if ongoing domestic political issues and turmoil in the region will deal the country and its tourism industry another blow. Sofra, like many prospective Western tourists in recent years, had been simultaneously drawn to the country—with its rich culture and unique natural landscapes—and unsure about safety. In the end, she decided to book a spot on a hop-on hop-off tourist bus traveling through southern Turkey and to Cappadocia. She shared the small bus with three other solo female travelers, the driver, and a chaperone. “Traveling through the blue waters of Fethiye, to the tree houses of Olympos, and onto the mountains of Cappadocia via empty side roads, citrus trees, gas stations and dusty fruit stalls, it was quite evident along the way we were the only bus in sight,” she wrote in her travel journal. "If you''d like to find out more about Turkey, let me start with my necklace," begins this visitor on Olympos Beach. Tourism in Turkey took a nosedive beginning in late 2015, in the wake of a series of terrorist attacks in the country, including one in June 2016 targeting Ataturk Airport and another early on New Year’s Day 2017 at a popular nightclub in Istanbul. A failed coup attempt in July 2016 also led to a wide-ranging government crackdown on opponents of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and an ongoing political tightening. A political dispute with Russia—traditionally one of the major sources of foreign tourists to Turkey—broke out in late 2015 after Turkish fighter jets shot down a Russian war plane near the Syrian border. Russia slapped Turkey with sanctions and a travel ban as a result, further cutting into visitor numbers. According to Turkey’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the total number of foreign visitors entering Turkey plummeted from 36.2 million in 2015 to 25.4 million in 2016—a drop of 30 percent. Tourism from the United States fell more than 40 percent from 2015 to 2017, according to the New York Times, which notes a particular reluctance among Western travelers. But now, after a period of relative calm, tourists are returning. In 2017, the number of foreign visitors had rebounded to 32.4 million, with increased popularity among tourists from Russia, Asia and the Middle East. The Association of Turkish Travel Agencies predicted earlier this year that the number would climb to 40 million in 2018, bringing $30 billion in revenue, according to the state-run Andolu Agency. A bus driver and guides speak about their fears of unemployment while watching balloons rise. The latest statistics from July 2018 showed numbers reaching or exceeding pre-crisis levels. In that month, 5.6 million foreign visitors entered the country, compared to 3.5 million in the same month in 2016. In 2015, the number was 5.5 million. The largest share of foreign tourists came from Russia, followed by Germany and the United Kingdom. The Association of British Travel Agents listed the country as one of the trending destinations for British tourists in 2018. As for Sofra, she said she carried back with her a new love for the Turkish people. In her travel journal, she wrote that she would remember “the delicateness and the passion for family and friends, the simplicity of their wholesome cuisine, the peaceful mornings and nights watching the golden sun, the hard work ethic with no complaints, the electricity released as they danced to any music at any time, even without an audience.” A bird''s-eye view shows a single balloon hovering over the marble landscape of Cappadocia.

(230, '87 Elephants Poached in Africa’s ‘Last Safe Haven’', 'Experts explain how the slaughter could happen in Botswana, which may no longer be the refuge it’s long been thought of.', 'At least 87 elephants have been killed for their ivory in Botswana in recent months, according to the conservation nonprofit Elephants Without Borders, which discovered the carcasses. It’s a sharp and disturbing increase in poaching for a country that has been considered elephants’ last stronghold in Africa, says Mike Chase, the organization’s director. “It came as a complete shock that we were discovering elephants that were poached deep within Botswana, within some world-renowned tourist concessions,” he says. “It was completely unexpected.” Elephants Without Borders was conducting aerial surveys for the Botswana government when observers began noticing carcasses around the Okavango Delta, a UNESCO World Heritage region far from the Namibian and Zimbabwean borders where poaching incidents have occurred more commonly in the country. The organization conducts an elephant census for the government every four years. The most recent census, in 2014, found nine recently killed elephants. This year’s survey, which is only halfway complete, has already found 87. Botswana’s Department of Wildlife and National Parks today issued a statement saying the Elephants Without Borders claims are “false and misleading.” The statement says only 53 were counted and that many had died from natural causes. Chase stands by his numbers. “I am an objective scientist, with no political agenda. I am sad that our government has responded in this way.” He says there’s a GPS location for each of the 87 carcasses and that there are multiple witnesses who saw each one. Every flight has four people, including one government employee, and voice recordings from the flights will bear out these findings, Chase says. Explore a country-by-country look at the population status of the African savanna elephant. The Great Elephant Census surveyed sites throughout the continent in 2014 and 2015. During this period, Chad had the steepest decline, followed by Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania. Botswana is home to more than 130,000 elephants—about a third of Africa’s savanna elephants—and it appeared to have largely escaped the recent ivory poaching crisis. Continent-wide elephant numbers dropped by 30 percent between 2007 and 2014, according to the Great Elephant Census, an 18-country comprehensive aerial elephant count conducted by Elephants Without Borders that was completed in 2016. Elephants play a critical role in Botswana’s tourist economy, which drew nearly two million international visitors in 2017. The discovery of these carcasses, which Chase says are mainly of older males with big tusks, could indicate a growing infiltration of organized poaching teams into the country. It comes at a time when humans are increasingly in conflict with elephants—in part because of Botswana’s comparatively large elephant numbers. And it comes just as the government has decided to take weapons away from its rangers. For decades Botswana has taken an aggressive approach toward poachers. During the late 1980s, former president Ian Khama, then the commander of the Botswana Defense Force (BDF), deployed 800 soldiers to help combat poaching and to assist anti-poaching game rangers. In 2014 Botswana adopted a unwritten shoot-to-kill policy, of debatable legality. In May, Botswana’s new president Mokgweetsi Masisi decided to disarm the country’s anti-poaching unit. The month before when Masisi was sworn in, he discovered that there was never a legal framework for arming the anti-poaching unit. That’s why their weapons were taken away, says Dereck Joubert, a wildlife filmmaker and National Geographic explorer-in-residence based in Botswana. The Department of Wildlife and National Parks calls it a “corrective measure.” Disarming the anti-poaching unit has led some, including Chase, to conclude that the recent killings were at least partly linked to the decision. While shoot-to-kill has always been a controversial anti-poaching strategy, giving rangers weapons has not. “I find it very difficult that any government would send its citizens out to the front lines to fight highly organized criminal networks who are armed to the teeth without weapons,” Chase says. “This is the largest elephant range left on the planet. It is very remote and difficult to access, and expecting the BDF [to handle it on their own] is not fair.” Still, Joubert finds it hard to believe that the disarming of the unit was the cause of these recent elephant killings. “To say the poaching occurred because the weapons were taken [from the anti-poaching unit] away doesn’t make any sense. There are still 800 armed BDF out there,” he says. Goemeone Mogomotsi, a legal officer at the University of Botswana who has studied the country’s anti-poaching strategies, called the decision to disarm the anti-poaching unit “unfortunate and regressive.” In a 2017 paper by Mogomotsi and his colleague Patricia Kefilwe Madigele, the co-authors argue that Botswana has become a haven for elephants precisely because it armed its game rangers and deployed the military to conservation areas. (They also argue that Botswana’s shoot-to-kill policy helped as well, though this contention is strongly disputed by other scholars and is opposed by human rights advocates.) The cause of the poaching of these 87 elephants is likely more complex than just the rangers’ disarmament, says Vanda Felab-Brown, a crime and security expert at the Brookings Institute. “The announcement [that rangers would be disarmed] probably significantly contributed to temptation by poachers to intensify hunting. But I think it’s simplistic to portray this as the sole cause,” she says. Poaching incidents have been increasing in Botswana during the past two years, she says, both at the community level and the professionalized level. She and Chase both make the point that as elephants have nearly been wiped out in neighboring countries, trafficking networks are likely moving into Botswana, where there are more animals to hunt. Felab-Brown also posits that Botswana’s 2014 hunting ban may have led to more poaching. Communities that previously benefited from the trophy hunting industry and related tourism services lost employment opportunities and sources of income when the ban went into effect. Photographic tourism didn’t increase enough to make up the difference, according to recent research by Joseph Mbaiwa at the Okavango Research Institute, at University of Botswana. Communities also lost an important source of game meat, and the lack of hunting meant more more wildlife on village doorsteps. That has led to more encounters between people and elephants, thereby increasing the incentive to kill encroaching animals illegally. These factors combined to cause people living in rural areas to develop more negative attitudes toward wildlife, according to Mbaiwa, and that in turn may have spurred an increase in poaching. Joubert disagrees. He says that when hunting was allowed, concessions were only occupied five months out of the year, leaving those areas especially vulnerable to poachers during the other seven months. With photographic tourism, the concessions are occupied year-round. The demand for elephant ivory comes mainly from Asia, where it’s seen as a status symbol by some. Ivory is carved into tusk-size sculptures, figurines, chopsticks, jewelry, and a myriad of other items. While the international trade in ivory has been banned since 1990, the domestic trade in China remained legal until the end of 2017. China’s landmark decision to close its ivory market was celebrated around the world. But, says Felab-Brown, the fact that these 87 elephants were recently killed in a place like Botswana seems to indicate that the ban hasn’t had the immediate effect many expected. “The ban has been effect for nine months, and this is still happening. It means there is still a lot of flow somewhere,” she says. “The Chinese market has not dried up.” Hong Kong and Japan, both of which have legal domestic ivory markets, remain major destinations for illegal ivory, as does China and the United States. “It’s a bleak time in elephant conservation right now,” Chase says. Joubert cautions against implying that there’s a poaching free-for-all in Botswana right now. Still, he says, “Even if one elephant has been killed, it’s one elephant too many. We have to mobilize. We have to make sure it doesn’t escalate.” ', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/09/wildlife-watch-news-botswana-elephants-poaching.html', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/2018/09/elephant-poaching-botswana/01-elephant-poaching-botswana-nationalgeographic_1581890.jpg', '2018-09-05T07:00:16.3203304Z', 255, 3),

Now, one of Latin America''s largest natural history museums is a burnt-out husk of its former self. A massive fire broke out at the museum late September 2, torching its exhibits and some 90 percent of the museum''s 20 million artifacts. There were no reported fatalities. As firefighters worked to put out the blaze, some museum staffers and volunteers pulled what they could from the building, including part of the museum''s mollusk collection. The museum''s Bendegó meteorite, the largest ever found in Brazil, is one of the few objects that survived direct contact with the flames. Scientists also hold out hope that some of the objects in the archaeology and paleontology collections may have been stored in metal containers that shielded them. Duane Fonseca, a biologist at Brazil''s Federal University of Rio Grande, reported on Twitter on Tuesday that some 80 percent of the museum''s key invertebrate reference specimens were in another building during the fire and unharmed, along with the museum''s library and botanical archive. And recently, researchers had 3-D scanned some of the museum''s Egyptian artifacts, preserving at least their forms for posterity. See 3-D scans of some of the Museu Nacional''s artifacts. But most of the collection—the product of lifetimes'' worth of scholarly work and exploration—is now likely lost, including rare fossils and audio recordings from indigenous peoples, some of languages that are no longer spoken by living tribes. “The importance of the collections that were lost couldn''t be overstated,” Luiz Rocha, a Brazilian ichthyologist who has studied the Museu Nacional''s collections several times, told National Geographic in a previous interview. “They were unique as it gets: Many of them were irreplaceable, there''s no way to put a monetary value on it.” Scholars have sharply criticized the Brazilian government for the tragedy, which they say was preventable. Years of budget cuts and delayed renovations left the Museu Nacional with peeling walls and exposed electrical wiring. When firefighters arrived on the scene, the area''s two fire hydrants were reportedly empty, forcing rescue crews to draw water from water trucks or a nearby lake. Since news of the inferno broke Sunday, people and museums around the world have mourned the museum''s loss. “On this dark day for not only Brazilian heritage but also for the world''s heritage, we wish to reiterate our unshakeable belief in the resilience and professionalism of Brazil''s museum professionals, and our faith in their ability to recover from this painful event,” the International Council of Museums said in a statement. Debate already swirls around whether, or how, the Museu Nacional should be rebuilt. But in the meantime, local students have started work on a rebuilding project of their own. “In the face of tonight''s tragedy, the students of the museology course at UNIRIO [the Federal University for the State of Rio de Janeiro] are mobilizing to preserve the memory of the National Museum,” the Museu Nacional said in an email. “We ask everyone who possesses images (photographs/videos/even selfies) of the collection and exhibition spaces to share them with us.” ', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/09/news-pictures-museu-nacional-fire-aftermath-natural-history.html', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/science/2018/09/05/brazil_museum_gallery/01_brazil_museum_gallery_rts1zt3m.jpg', '2018-09-05T07:00:14.5546839Z', 213, 3),

(234, 'Woodward''s revelations raise disturbing questions about Trump', 'If Bob Woodward is right, the United States and the world face an imminent, dangerous emergency: There is an "unhinged" "liar," a "fifth grade" intellect and an aggrieved and abusive "Shakespearean king" raging in the Oval Office.', 'Washington (CNN)If Bob Woodward is right, the United States and the world face an imminent, dangerous emergency: There is an "unhinged" "liar," a "fifth grade" intellect and an aggrieved and abusive "Shakespearean king" raging in the Oval Office. That is the word -- rendered by the ultimate Washington insider reporter -- of some of Trump''s closest aides who feel they must protect the commander in chief from himself and the world from him. A President who prizes loyalty and self-image above all is left exposed and isolated in his own White House, viewed with contempt by those who serve him and open to ridicule by others who see his swaggering, domineering brand as a front for inadequacy. The most serious question raised by Woodward''s new book is the idea that the people in the Situation Room alongside Trump view him as so lacking in sophistication and judgment that they take extreme measures -- described as an "administrative coup d''etat" -- to sidestep the threat they perceive he poses to national security. Given the rich texture of a book stitched with conversations and comments from top officials that drip with disdain for the President, there must be significant doubt whether top White House and administration staffers can just brazen out the storm and go on as before. While some critics have questioned Woodward''s methods in the past, his credibility of a lifetime of reporting, and the sheer volume and staggering nature of the revelations contained in "Fear: Trump in the White House," are strong arguments as to its authenticity. Notwithstanding the carefully worded denials of those quoted, Woodward''s revelations must raise questions about the extent to which top officials owe the public an explanation. If key figures such as chief of staff John Kelly, former top economic adviser Gary Cohn and Defense Secretary James Mattis are really intervening regularly to avert national security disasters, should they not make their worries known to the American people and the Congress? Or is the continued service of some top subordinates, despite the personal and reputational cost, an act of selfless patriotism that could avert further damage? There could also be political implications from the new Woodward blockbuster. If his version of events, backed up by exhaustive interviews and tapes, is a real reflection of the situation, how much longer can Republicans, who have shielded Trump for nearly two years, continue to defend and sustain him? Then there is the impact on the President''s mood and psyche. He has already given every impression of wallowing in fury and resentment. Now, with his inner circle of aides apparently dumping on him, he is likely to be even more brittle and alone. That could translate into fury on Twitter, even more volatile reactions to key global controversies and ever more fervent attempts to change the subject -- emotions that often translate into diatribes against top targets like Attorney General Jeff Sessions or special counsel Robert Mueller''s Russia probe. Woodward''s books have often specialized in debunking the illusion of a highly competent president and the cult of infallibility that sprouts around the Oval Office. His new offering, which comes out next Tuesday, is slightly different -- and that may make it even more damaging -- since it appears to confirm in detail and documentation many previous accounts of an off-the-rails presidency and a mercurial commander in chief. Still, the immediate reaction of those quoted lambasting their boss by Woodward was damage control. Kelly denied calling Trump an "idiot." The President''s former lawyer John Dowd refuted a claim that he had warned that his client''s lies would end up with him in an "orange jump suit." Mattis said he had never used "contemptuous" words about Trump -- such as the claim the commander in chief had the intellect of a fifth- or six-grader, which was reported by Woodward in the book, obtained by CNN. There was no comment from Cohn, who was said to have taken a document off of Trump''s desk that could have jeopardized a missile early-warning system on the Korean Peninsula, saying, "Got to protect the country." Trump followed up the sequence of administration denials with a tweet -- his tested method of signaling to supporters that any criticism is all just a partisan plot. "The Woodward book has already been refuted and discredited by General (Secretary of Defense) James Mattis and General (Chief of Staff) John Kelly. Their quotes were made up frauds, a con on the public. Likewise other stories and quotes. Woodward is a Dem operative? Notice timing?" Given that the White House is being portrayed in the throes of a "nervous breakdown of the executive power of the most powerful country in the world," Woodward''s book could also manifest itself as useful intelligence for America''s foes who want to test Trump. It is likely to inject new political toxins into the midterm election campaign, as well. The question it is impossible to answer right now is whether the Woodward storm will thrash through Washington and blow itself out -- as the history of Trump the politician suggests it might -- and things will go back to normal until the next damaging exposés. Or is the book so credible and corrosive to Trump''s image that it helps build increasing disquiet about his presidency to a critical mass that could begin to unpick the political realities and staunch GOP support that have sustained him in office so far? After all, the book comes out at a rough moment for the President. He stirred widespread disapproval for his refusal to honor Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who died late last month. The President also perhaps has increased personal legal exposure from the convictions of two people who were once close to him, his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his personal lawyer Michael Cohen. It''s by now a cliché that Trump''s loyal base will not desert him, whatever happens. His conservative media cheerleaders are certain to ride into battle to discredit Woodward -- though he is not known as a partisan and has tormented Democratic as well as Republican presidents. It''s possible that yet more unflattering reports about the President''s conduct and character could add to GOP difficulties -- especially among more moderate voters in suburban districts that might end up being especially crucial in the battle for control of the House of Representatives. The very fact of the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, an authentic conservative Supreme Court nominee, this week explains why many Republicans have been willing to ignore previous exposés alleging Trump is incompetent and poorly suited to the presidency. But there were genuine signs of disgust on Capitol Hill over offensive attacks leveled at Sessions by the President, as reported by Woodward. The Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter quoted Trump as calling Sessions, who is frequently a target of his rage, as a "dumb southerner" and "mentally retarded." There is often a disconnect between how Washington and media elites perceive Trump''s most explosive comments and how they are interpreted elsewhere -- especially in regions that strongly favor the President and his unchained style. But the "southern" jibe at Sessions at least appeared to have the potential to offend some of the President''s most committed supporters. It certainly didn''t sit well with some senators from Trump country. "I resent that," Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican, told CNN''s Manu Raju. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who often defends the President, said the feud with Sessions made him uncomfortable and that if Trump had indeed made such remarks it would be "inappropriate." But while praising Woodward as a good reporter, Graham added: "Most people in the South like what Trump''s doing. They''re not going to read this book."

Even if it means sacrificing everything" in white letters was printed over Kaepernick''s face. The giant billboard in San Francisco''s Union Square is part of Colin Kaepernick''s “Just Do It” campaign for Nike. Is the campaign a declaration of war? via @scottostlerhttps://t.co/AdrnBmn769 His activism began when he kneeled during the national anthem of football games to protest social injustice. Nike aimed to reference the movement he sparked, the report said. Kaepernick is currently unsigned and has a pending lawsuit against the National Football League, which he accuses of blacklisting him. The company famous for the swoosh is now facing backlash since its announcement of the campaign. President Trump weighed in on Tuesday, telling The Daily Caller that he "thinks it''s a terrible message." Trump said it’s Nike''s right to make its own business decisions, as much as he disagrees with the endorsement, according to the report. "It is what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn’t do, but I personally am on a different side of it,” the president said. Kaepernick already had a deal with Nike that was set to expire, but it was renegotiated into a multiyear deal to make him one of the faces of the anniversary campaign, according to a person familiar with the contract. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Nike hasn''t officially announced the contract. Amy Lieu is a news editor and reporter for Fox News.

The $17.7 billi…', 'Morgan Stanley  has valued Tesla’s  autonomous vehicle ride-sharing business, which does not yet exist, at $17.7 billion, about one-tenth of Waymo’s value, yet still above GM Cruise, the investment firm said in a research note published Tuesday. The $17.7 billion valuation, or about $95 per Tesla share, is notably lower than the $244 a share that Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said the service was worth in 2015. (Keep in mind this valuation is just for Tesla’s autonomous vehicle ride-sharing network, not the entire company.) Morgan Stanley’s current price target for Tesla is $291 a share. Placing a value on a business that doesn’t exist may seem, well, premature. But in Morgan Stanley’s view, it reflects Tesla’s stagnation in this area as much as the progress made by other autonomous vehicle technology companies such as Cruise and Waymo . Jonas noted that Tesla has shared “extremely few details about how shared autonomy can be positioned as a separate business model,” while Cruise and Waymo have become “increasingly conspicuous with their efforts to grow the business with specific targets for commercialization and deployment.” Tesla’s higher cost of capital compared to Waymo and potentially less room for adjacent revenue monetization were also cited as reasons for the lower valuation. “In our opinion, Tesla may one day need to make a strategic decision over whether to pursue a shared autonomy strategy on “go-it-alone” basis or whether to find ways to “attach” their vehicle data and fleet management ecosystem to one or more external platforms that maybe in a far better position to pursue data monetization, improved customer engagement/experience and lower cost to the consumer,” Jonas wrote in the research note. Three years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk  floated an idea for a network of autonomous vehicles that Tesla owners could put to use on a ride-sharing service to earn a bit of extra money. Few details about this Tesla Network have emerged since then. The most recent smidge of information came from Musk during the company’s first-quarter earnings call in May when he said that from a “technical standpoint” Tesla vehicles would be capable of full autonomy by the end of this year. He also noted that regulatory approval made it difficult to predict timing of an actual launch. In the meantime, companies like Waymo and GM’s Cruise have ramped up their deployment plans for autonomous vehicle ride-hailing services. Morgan Stanley does predict that Tesla will take the lead, at least initially. Jonas predicts that Tesla’s autonomous vehicle ride-sharing network will have more vehicles, more miles traveled and greater revenue than Waymo by 2030. However, the Waymo figures continue to ramp up very significantly through 2040, reaching $724 billion of revenue and $92 billion of operating profit by 2040, Jonas wrote. “In short, we assume Tesla gets off to a faster start than Waymo in terms of shared miles accumulation, but that Waymo catches up and surpasses Tesla just a few years later and with likely a more sustainable and protected business model,” Jonas wrote. The forecast places Waymo at the top with a $175 valuation, Tesla at $17.7 billion, and Cruise trailing with a $11.5 billion valuation.

Typhoon Jebi peeled roofs off buildings, flipped vehicles, toppled power poles and sent a 2,700-tonne tanker crashing into the side of a bridge. The operator of flooded Kansai International Airport, where around 3,000 tourists were stranded while the storm crossed over Japan, began transferring passengers by high-speed boat and bus to nearby Kobe port. One passenger was slightly injured by shards from a window shattered by the storm, and others said they were exhausted but relieved that the worst had passed. Jebi has now been downgraded to a tropical storm, and is heading north of Japan. At its peak it was briefly a super typhoon, meaning wind speeds exceeded 150mph. The tanker that was in the process of mooring had slammed into the side of a bridge connecting the airport to the mainland, damaging the bridge and rendering one of the two roads over it unusable, transport ministry official Mitsuo Nakao said. The tanker was also damaged, but all its 11 crewmembers were not injured and rescued safely, according to the coast guard. The heavily damaged ship has been pulled away from the bridge into nearby open waters. The deaths included a man in his 70s who was blown to the ground from his apartment in Osaka prefecture. Police said five others died elsewhere in the prefecture after being hit by flying objects or falling from their apartments. In nearby Shiga prefecture, a 71-year-old man died when a storage building collapsed on him, and a man in his 70s died after falling from a roof in Mie, officials said. Daihatsu Motor Co. stopped production at its Kyoto and Osaka factories, while Panasonic halted work at its air conditioning and refrigerator factory in Shiga. Major beverage maker Kirin Co. suspended production at its brewery in Kobe, according to Kyodo News agency. In nearby Nishinomiya in Hyogo prefecture, about 100 cars at a seaside dealership burned after their electrical systems were shorted out by sea water, fire officials and news reports said. And in Osaka, the Universal Studios Japan theme park remained closed for a second straight day. A news release said it would open again on Thursday. Videos posted to social media during the storm showed the Tempozan Ferris Wheel, an Osaka landmark which was also closed, nonetheless spinning at high speed as it was caught in the wind. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in all about 300 people were injured on Tuesday. "The government will continue to do everything possible to tackle these issues with utmost urgency," Suga told a news conference. It could take several days to a week to reopen Kansai airport depending on the damage, the Yomiuri newspaper quoted an unidentified person in the airline industry as saying. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, criticised for an initially slow response to devastating floods in July, posted repeated updates on the rescue efforts at Kansai. It is the latest in a string of extreme weather events to befall Japan, after a scorching heatwave and then torrential rains and flooding that killed more than 200 people in July. Jebi’s course brought it close to those flood-affected parts of western Japan, but most of the damage this time appeared to be from the wind.

"It completely shocked me when I heard," Fallon told the paper. Bobbitt’s attorneys requested that the couple remain in New Jersey, surrender their passports, post a bond and restrict access to their bank accounts after they failed to meet a court-ordered deadline to deliver any remaining money from the GoFundMe account, according to the paper. Last week, Superior Court Judge Paula T. Dow ordered the couple to wire the remaining funds to a trust for Bobbitt, and submit an accounting report of the donated money within 24 hours. Bobbitt has received roughly $75,000 dollars of the funds, which he used to purchase a camper and SUV – both of which he no longer has, the paper reported. D’Amico told the paper during an interview in August that the he controls the money in the account, and that he would dispense the funds when Bobbitt gets a job and stops using drugs. "Giving him all that money, it''s never going to happen. I''ll burn it in front of him," he said, adding that giving an "addict" the money would be like "giving him a loaded gun." Bobbitt admitted to the paper that the couple once gave him $25,000 and he spent it on giving it to relatives and friends, and some on drugs. Fallon told the paper on Tuesday that his client hopes to enter a residential detoxification program. Bobbitt, who questions the couple''s motives and fears they may have squandered the money, claims they used the funds to buy a new BMW and take lavish vacations. He also questions if the couple has the legal authority to deny him the money. Jacqueline Promislo, another lawyer for Bobbitt said the couple’s lawyer, Ernest E. Badway, never responded regarding the request to transfer the remaining GoFundMe funds or if the money had been moved, according to the paper. The paper could not reach McLure or D’Amico for comment. Badway declined to comment to the paper on Tuesday. The couple earlier said the new car was paid for with their own money. McLure, who is a receptionist, and D’Amico, who is a carpenter, said they have done nothing wrong and did everything they could to help Bobbitt. Badway claimed in court last week that Bobbitt stole at least $200,000 of the funds since the account was created, the paper reported. He also argued the court-order to wire the money within 24 hours was a “harsh remedy.” A hearing regarding the disputed funds is scheduled to take place Wednesday at 10 a.m., the paper reported. GoFundMe has donated $20,000 into an escrow account created by Bobbitt’s attorneys to help with housing and goods as the legal proceedings continue, a spokesman told the paper on Tuesday. The company also said it is cooperating with the investigation. Benjamin Brown is a reporter for Fox News. Follow him on Twitter @bdbrown473.

The company today has announced that it has acquired Alpine.AI (pr…', 'Headspace, a meditation app with 31 million users that is valued at $320 million, is doubling down on voice and A.I. technology to help differentiate itself from the rest of the wellness pack. The company today has announced that it has acquired Alpine.AI (previously called VoiceLabs), one of the early players in the digital assistant market, to bring more voice interaction into its main app. “There are a few meditation apps out there right now…but the ability to react to where you are in your journey with specific advice through voice applications will be [far ahead] of where our competitors are,” says Headspace’s  new CTO Paddy Hannon, who will lead the Alpine team of four who are joining Headspace’s offices in San Francisco. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the acquisition includes both the team and the technology, Headspace said. The team joining will include Alpine.AI co-founder and CTO Alexandre Linares and three engineers. Alpine.AI CEO Adam Marchick will retain an advisory role going forward. VoiceLabs had experimented across a number of voice-based products over the years. They included a voice advertising product that Amazon squashed; an analytics service for voice app developers; and most recently, a solution that could build voice shopping apps by importing retailers’ catalogs and using A.I. to answer customer questions about those products. The latter, known as Alpine.AI, is what Headspace found most interesting. Alpine.AI was working on solutions for retailers, which would allow customers to talk to their voice assistants naturally. For example, asking for a mascara, the voice assistant would respond with things like, “What color?” and “Do you want it to be waterproof?” Headspace is not about to start selling make-up, but it does see potential in applying Alpine.AI’s machine learning technologies to its own domain. Today, Headspace’s primary interface is audio. Users are guided through meditation sessions by the soothing, calm and distinctive voice of Andi Puddicombe, the co-founder who is a former Tibetan monk. Building on that foundation, the plan will be to implement Alpine.AI’s technology to give people an interactive voice-based way to discover the different meditation sessions available on Headspace, and to use those interactions to make better suggestions to individual users. A consumer might tell Headspace they’re “stressed out,” and the app would make an appropriate recommendation based on the customer’s history in the app. The addition of Alpine’s technology could be a competitive advantage for Headspace, in the crowded and growing field of self-care apps. Headspace is just ahead of chief rival Calm.com in terms of valuation, with the latter at around $277 million, according to data from PitchBook. Beyond the initial advantage of improving Headspace’s voice apps, Hannon says Alpine’s technology can be put to use in other ways, as well, including within its iOS and Android apps where users’ actions — not a voice command — could be the trigger that kicks off a personalized suggestion. Hannon says Alpine.AI was also appealing because of how it was built. “They built everything on Amazon. They use Docker. This was another reason it was a very attractive acquisition,” Hannon explains. “They built software using the same patterns that we build our software with internally. They’re leveraging much of the same database technologies that we’re using. They use REST services like we do…so from an infrastructure perspective, it was very straightforward. “I think where it’s going to be interesting is attaching our audio content to their text-based system. But when you look at what Amazon’s providing with things like Lex right now, there’s a lot of text-to-speech or speech-to-text systems, that I think will enable us to do that implementation,” he added. The deal is also about betting on the future of voice computing. The number of voice-enabled digital assistant devices has grown to over 1 billion worldwide over the past two-and-a-half years. Today, 20 percent of U.S. households have a dedicated smart speaker, and that number is expected to grow.

Alpine.AI was a seed-stage company at the time of the acquisition, having raised “a few million” from investors including The Chernin Group, Javelin Venture Partners and Betaworks. But while voice-enabled smart speakers have proven to have some popularity, we’ve yet to see many startups working in voice-based interfaces scale up and take on the likes of Nuance or other large platform players like Apple, Google and Amazon. This might have been part of the reason why Alpine.AI was an attractive acquisition target (and was also open to the exit).

The Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) also announced today that it has acquired the Xbox Adaptive Controller for display in its Rapid Response gallery dedicated to current events and pop culture. First introduced in May, the Xbox Adaptive Controller can now be purchased online for $99.99. To create the controller, Microsoft collaborated with gamers with disabilities and limited mobility, as well as partners from several organizations, including the AbleGamers Charity, the Cerebral Palsy Foundation, Special Effect and Warfighter Engaged. According to Microsoft,  the Xbox Adaptive Controller project first took root in 2014 when one of its engineers spotted a custom gaming controller made by Warfighter Engaged, a non-profit that provides gaming devices for wounded and disabled veterans. During several of Microsoft’s hackathons, teams of employees began working on gaming devices for people with limited mobility, which in turn gave momentum to the development of the Xbox Adaptive Controller. In its announcement, the V&A said it added the Xbox Adaptive Controller to its collection because “as the first adaptive controller designed and manufactured at large-scale by a leading technology company, it represents a landmark moment in videogame play, and demonstrates how design can be harnessed to encourage inclusively and access.” The Xbox Adaptive Controller features two large buttons that can be programmed to fit its user’s needs, as well as 19 jacks and two USB ports that are spread out in a single line on the back of the device to make them easier to access. Symbols embossed along the back of the controller’s top help identify ports so gamers don’t have to turn it around or lift it up to find the one they need, while grooves serve as guidelines to help them plug in devices. Based on gamer feedback, Microsoft moved controls including the D Pad to the side of the device and put the A and B buttons closer together, so users can easily move between them with one hand. The controller slopes down toward the front, enabling gamers to slide their hands onto it without having to lift them (and also makes it easier to control with feet) and has rounded edges to reduce the change of injury if it’s dropped on a foot. The Xbox Adaptive Controller was designed to rest comfortably in laps and also has three threaded inserts so it can be mounted with hardware to wheelchairs, lap boards or desks. In terms of visual design, the Xbox Adaptive Controller is sleek and unobtrusive, since Microsoft heard from many gamers with limited mobility that they dislike using adaptive devices because they often look like toys. The company’s attention to detail also extends into the controller’s packaging, which is very easy to unbox because gamers told Microsoft that they are often forced to open boxes and other product packages with their teeth.

(246, 'Rahm Emanuel will not seek re-election as mayor of Chicago', 'After two terms, voters have grown weary of his centrist politics', 'TO WIN elections, a certain degree of likeability is indispensable. That was a problem for Rahm Emanuel, who surprised everyone on September 4th by saying he won’t, after all, seek re-election as Chicago’s mayor after two terms in office. It appears that he expected to be humiliated in the election early next year. “Rahmbo”, as he is known, renowned as a tough fighter in his 23 years in politics, thus made an uncharacteristically meek decision to bow out. It was probably the right one. Problems were piling up for the mayor of America’s third-largest city. Mr Emanuel, once chief of staff for President Barack Obama and close to the Clintons, is an abrasive figure with no strong base of local support. He won comfortably in 2011 but then struggled to beat an ill-prepared opponent in a run-off in 2015. In both elections more than half of his support came from wards dominated by black residents. (Chicago is heavily segregated and split roughly evenly between white, black and Latino blocks of voters.) Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. Natalie Moore, who analyses Chicago politics in her book, “The South Side”, suggests Mr Emanuel largely owed his African-American support to his links with Mr Obama. Now that those links have lost their relevance, residents’ dislike of Mr Emanuel, who is perceived as “brusque”, “iron-fisted” and beholden to rich donors and corporate interests, has begun to play a bigger role. That Mr Emanuel earned $18m in a brief career in finance contributed to perceptions of him as an outsider. Voters respected Mr Emanuel as an effective champion of business, who did what he could to fix the city’s dismal finances. But they never really warmed to him. His approval ratings slipped below 25% in the past year, though they have since recovered somewhat thanks to a high-profile spat with Donald Trump, the president. He was blamed for failing to reform rotten public schools and for rising property taxes. Worse is his record on gun violence, in which young, black men are overwhelmingly the victims. He badly mishandled the aftermath of a police killing in 2014 in which a young man, Laquan MacDonald, was shot 16 times. When police belatedly released footage of the incident, it looked disturbingly like a summary execution, resulting in angry protests. Had the video been released before the 2015 election Mr Emanuel would almost certainly have lost.  Some speculate that the trial of the policeman accused of the killing, which is set to begin on September 5th, will produce testimony that is awkward for the mayor. Even if it doesn’t, perceptions of gun violence remain resolutely grim. “There was no way he was going to get the majority of the black vote again” says Dick Simpson, a professor at the University of Illinois in Chicago. Mr Emanuel will see out his term until next May. Mayoral candidates will face a non-party primary election in February, which Democrats will dominate, possibly followed by a run-off election in April. The race could give a hint whether more left-leaning candidates are ascendant in the party. Lori Lightfoot, a gay, African-American woman who has scrutinised police violence in the city, is one such candidate. Mr Emanuel’s pragmatic centrism may have looked increasingly unexciting for many Democratic voters in the current political climate. That could bode ill for another possible successor, Paul Vallas, a softly-spoken white man with a record of school reform.

Mike Capuano, D-Mass., in a Democratic primary Tuesday.', 'WASHINGTON — A month ago, Ayanna Pressley told NBC News she was in “a fight for the soul of our party.” On Tuesday night, she won it. In a stunning upset in John F. Kennedy’s old congressional district, Pressley, the first woman of color elected to Boston’s City Council, defeated Rep. Mike Capuano, D-Mass., a 10-term incumbent in a high-profile Democratic primary. Polls had shown Capuano, who has never faced a serious challenge since being elected in 1998, with big leads. But Pressley defied the odds to not just win, but outpace Capuano so decisively that he conceded the race less than an hour and a half after polls closed. She appears to have done it by turning out young people and people of color, neither of whom typically vote in party primaries. With more than 90 percent of precincts reporting, Pressley had 58.4 percent, or 50,917 votes, to Capuano''s 41.6 percent, or 36,234 votes. "Clearly the district wanted a lot of change,” Capuano told supporters. Unlike Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., who was caught off-guard when he lost his own primary this summer, Capuano recognized the threat early. And unlike Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who beat Crowley, Pressley has been a rising Democratic star for years. “Ayanna Pressley is going to be a good congresswoman and I will tell you that Massachusetts will be well served,” the defeated congressman said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who donated to Capuano''s campaign, thanked him for his long service, before saying she looked forward to welcoming Pressley to the caucus. The heavily Democratic district has no danger of falling into Republicans'' hands. Capuano had no whiff of scandal and has a nearly perfect progressive voting record.But he hails from an older, more parochial school of politics which Pressley said didn''t cut it anymore in the Donald Trump era. More importantly, Massachusetts’ 7th Congressional District is the only one in New England where racial minorities outnumber whites and Pressley argued she could better represent the Boston and Cambridge-area district than Capuano, who is white. "It''s not just good enough to see the Democrats back in power, it matters who those Democrats are," Pressley told her own supporters. "While our president is a racist, misogynistic, truly empathy-bankrupt man, the conditions which have made the 7th CD one of the most unequal in America were cemented through policies made long before he ever descended the escalator at Trump tower." Pressley, too, took a moment to praise her opponent, recalling moments when they shared a bullhorn at local political rallies and demonstrations. "He forced me to bring my best, just like in this," she said. While there was little ideological daylight between the candidates, it’s another victory for the insurgent left, which has seen its biggest successes with candidates of color who embrace progressive ideology, such as with Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and Ocasio-Cortez, who vocally supported Pressley. Congratulations to my sister in service, @AyannaPressley, on continuing her historic path into Congress tonight.Let’s push together to make Medicare for All, tuition free college, & living wages a reality in America - all without corporate PAC money.  https://t.co/o2SbtUkByS "The winning strategy in the future of the Democratic Party points to exciting a broad, multiracial coalition of the grassroots — new voters, young voters, and people of color," said Mari Urbana, the political director of the liberal group Indivisible. Urbana said Indivisible has been pushing Democratic voters to get more involved in primaries, where individuals can often have a bigger impact, and Pressley''s victory is proof of that strategy. "It’s just such a big deal for the entire movement," she said. Jeffrey Brown, an associate pastor at the Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury, an African-American neighborhood in Boston, said residents there have dreamed of getting a person of color in the district. In fact, it was specifically redrawn to make that possibility more likely. "They were taking up not only the hope of Pressley as a congresswoman, but the hope that this community will finally get some of their issues heard and addressed from someone who truly understands them," said Brown, who endorsed Pressley. Pressley has spoken often about being raised by a single mother because her father was incarcerated or struggling with addiction, and her campaign focused on themes of racial, economic, and geographic inequality. Most elected Democrats in Massachusetts and Washington sided with Capuano. And Brown said he was disappointed to see the Congressional Black Caucus prioritize loyalty to a fellow incumbent over the possibility of growing their ranks. "I don’t even know if she should join the Congressional Black Caucus. None of them supported her," he said. Even those who did not endorse Pressley for political reasons have said nice things about her. “I’m excited for her. I’m really feeling enormous sense of pride for what’s she’s accomplished,” former Massachusetts Sen.

Nike unveiled an ad campaign Monday featuring Kaepernick as an athlete who took a knee for justice "even if it means sacrificing everything," including his career with the league. NFL spokeswoman Jocelyn Moore said in a statement Tuesday that the issues raised by Kaepernick "deserve our attention and action." Kaepernick, then the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, sparked debate in the league and across America in 2016 when he began kneeling during the national anthem before games. While some other players followed suit, some fans, including President Donald Trump, characterized the protests as disrespectful to members of the armed forces. The next year Kaepernick opted out of his contract with 49ers, and his absence from the NFL since has been attributed by league critics to his pregame political displays. Kaepernick said his protests were about police brutality. "The National Football League believes in dialogue, understanding and unity," Moore said. "We embrace the role and responsibility of everyone involved with this game to promote meaningful, positive change in our communities. The social justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised deserve our attention and action." The league on Tuesday also highlighted its own post-Kaepernick "social justice initiative," which includes "a significant financial commitment" to issues of education and economic advancement, relationships between police and the communities officers serve, and support for criminal justice reform. Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL, accusing owners of conspiring to keep him out of the league because of his protests.

That’s ho…', 'The most interesting thing about Burning Man,  says me, is that it’s a testbed for a post-scarcity society. The irony of course is that such a testbed requires enormous amounts of money and resources, in a highly hostile and inaccessible environment. That’s how far you have to go to get away from the monetary / scarcity hierarchies of our world. It’s a lot of other things, of course: the world’s biggest, craziest, and most spectacular party, a huge EDM festival, a massive outdoor art gallery (both ephemeral and permanent — museum curators go out there to inspect the work with an eye towards adding to their collections), an experimental community, a secular pagan ritual, a set & setting for psychedelics, a holiday / reunion with one’s friends, etcetera etcetera. Amusingly it is widely misunderstood as a hippie event, when its flamethrowers:guitars ratio is roughly 100:1 and its mottos include “Safety Third” and “Keep Burning Man Potentially Lethal.” It is also even, sometimes, very weirdly, misinterpreted as some kind of holiday-hackathon extension of Silicon Valley. That last misunderstanding is instructive. The list of events this year included a so-called ‘VC/entrepreneur networking event and pitch session.’ I did not attend, but a close friend did, and reported “it was the ultimate Poe’s Law event … many people were genuinely crestfallen when they realized it was a joke.” It seems that the concept of a place that isn’t so much opposed to external social hierarchies as it is, much more interestingly, orthogonal to them — that’s a hard one for some people to to wrap their heads around. It’s true that Burning Man is very influential in the Valley, as this excellent Stanford News piece discusses. It’s true that there is a lot of amazing technology out there — this year featured a glorious swarm/murmuration of 600(!) drones, paired twenty-foot Tesla coils, a whole panoply of robots, etc. But its makers go to show off what they have built to their community, not in the hopes of filthy lucre. Don’t get me wrong. This experimental desert community very much has its own hierarchies, its own social capital, its own parasites, its own textbook full of unwritten rules, its own perfectly acceptable (indeed, proudly championed) logos. But the idea, at least, is: everyone works; everyone builds (if only a tent); everyone fights, and loses to, the dust; everyone amasses social capital by giving things and experiences rather than earning them; and everyone — whether riding atop a massive fire-breathing art car, or huddled in a mini-tent in the camp allotted to those bus riders who have nowhere else to go — is equally a participant, whether just helping and collaborating with those strangers in your immediate vicinity, or building some massive art/tech project for all to enjoy. This orthogonality to external hierarchies, this competition to give rather than to take, is what makes it a fascinating de facto testbed for a post-scarcity society, among other forms of experimental community. And maybe that’s why those who come but don’t participate in any community at all are so deeply scorned, loathed, and despised. I refer of course to the infamous “turnkey camps” of (often very) wealthy people who pay money to have their hexayurts erected, their food provided, their experience guided and curated — to be spectators at the spectacle, basically. To exist differently from everyone else at the event. To bring their hierarchical upper-tier existence from the outside world to the playa; to infect our testbed with boring old capitalism. It’s true that rich people, especially from the Valley, have been coming to Burning Man and enjoying expensive luxuries there for a very long time. In 2001, Larry and Sergey chose Eric Schmidt as Google’s CEO in part because he was the only candidate who had been to Burning Man. Mark Zuckerberg once choppered in and spent an afternoon giving away grilled cheese sandwiches. Elon Musk dismissed the TV show “Silicon Valley” because it didn’t reflect the side of the Valley he saw at Burning Man. But they still made that happen themselves. It’s only been over the last few years that the experience has — allegedly — been for sale as a package deal. This makes people very angry. Mostly, I think, because they are afraid. Capitalism is basically the Borg; it infects and subsumes everything it touches. Burning Man will become just another big party festival, is the fear, no longer an experimental community, much less a post-scarcity testbed. And yet. I happened to spend Saturday night surrounded by a bunch of very clean, very wealthy people from a turnkey camp. There were old men in civilian shorts; young men in completely spotless, glittering, top-end multi-thousand-dollar burnerwear; a woman in a don’t-look-at-me-I’m-totally-not-a-celebrity custom full-face golden mask. They acted as a classic tour group, except instead of following a flag, their lead sherpa held a ten-foot length of quarter-inch rebar topped with a blinking LED heart. And what I felt most, after I got over my initial resentment, was how sorry I was for them. I had solo camped in dusty squalor in the aforementioned bus camp … and I had clearly had a far more interesting and enjoyable time. Granted, I’m (relatively speaking) a crusty veteran of the event, but I suspect I would have had I been a virgin, too. And I think, as they looked around at the seventy thousand souls around them, many of whom were also very wealthy and could have purchased the turnkey experience, but instead chose to pour in an enormous amount of effort and experimentation, to construct colossal and/or intricate machines and/or monumental works of art, because they expected the rewards to be great — I think those much-loathed tourists knew this too. So never mind their invasion. I expect Burning Man to remain remarkably resistant to capitalism’s Borg, and therefore an interesting experimental proving ground — for cultures, communities, and technologies — for the foreseeable future. (As well as a completely ridiculous party populated by completely ridiculous people, which is also very much one of its faces.) I don’t expect the turnkey tourists to convert. They’re too committed to their own hierarchies. But I do think we live in a very interesting time of technology-enabled cultural and community experimentation, and, as silly and over-the-top as Burning Man can seem and be, those experiments there are genuinely valuable.

Also on Tuesday, in a major upset, Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley defeated 10-term incumbent Rep. Michael Capuano. Pressley, expected to be the first black woman elected to represent Massachusetts in Congress because she''s set to run unopposed in November, had the backing of Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And Rep. Richard Neal defeated Democratic primary challenger Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, an attorney who had hoped to make history herself by becoming the first Muslim elected to Congress from Massachusetts. She backed a proposal to make Medicare available to all Americans regardless of age. Fox News'' Samuel Chamberlain and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

(255, 'Another Democratic incumbent upset by primary challenger -- this time in Massachusetts', 'Democratic Rep. Mike Capuano has conceded defeat to Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley in the Massachusetts primary for his US House seat Tuesday, the latest upset to rock the Democratic Party and showcase a restive base eager for change.', '(CNN)Democratic Rep. Mike Capuano has conceded defeat to Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley in the Massachusetts primary for his US House seat Tuesday, the latest upset to rock the Democratic Party and showcase a restive base eager for change. Pressley''s win comes less than three months after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ousted the No. 4-ranking House Democrat, Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, in a primary. In his concession speech, Capuano said the district was clearly upset with the status quo and that he shared those feelings. "I will tell you, I''m sorry it didn''t work out but this is life and this is OK. America is going to be OK," Capuano said, adding, "Ayanna Pressley is going to be a good congresswoman and Massachusetts will be well served." Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley did not argue that Capuano was too moderate. In fact, she said, the two would vote the same way. Instead, the 44-year-old Pressley -- already a rising star in Democratic politics -- cast the race as about Democrats'' need for a new, more assertive style in the Donald Trump era. "This is a fight for the soul of our party. This is a fight for the future of our democracy," Pressley said at a recent canvassing event in Cambridge. "We might vote the same way, but we will lead differently. These times require and this district deserves bold, activist leadership." Ocasio-Cortez tweeted her support for Pressley on Tuesday night, writing "Congratulations to my sister in service, @AyannaPressley, on continuing her historic path into Congress tonight." Pressley is now poised to become the only black member of Massachusetts'' mostly male congressional delegation. She''d argued on the campaign trail that systemic inequalities had worsened in a district that was once represented by John F. Kennedy and where the majority of voters are nonwhite. "It''s about who I listen to and it''s about who I govern with. And there are a lot of people in this district who feel left out and left behind and ignored -- and it''s not just women, it''s not just people of color," Pressley told CNN in a recent interview. "It runs the gamut. And I think after a generation, the district deserves a choice." The race was just one of a slate of contested primaries in Massachusetts on Tuesday. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Republican Gov. Charlie Baker -- both heavily favored to win re-election -- both got general election opponents. Secretary of state Bill Galvin -- Massachusetts'' longest-serving statewide official, in office since 1995 -- fended off a Democratic primary challenge from Boston city councilor Josh Zakim, who conceded. The race focused on Massachusetts'' voting laws: Galvin highlighted changes that modernized the laws early in his tenure. But those laws now lag Democrats'' preference nationally for same-day and automatic voter registration -- which Zakim has pushed. Galvin has since endorsed those changes, too -- but Zakim has cast him as being slow to do so. Zakim had influential supporters, including Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and US Rep. Seth Moulton. Zakim also picked up the Massachusetts Democratic Party''s official endorsement. But Galvin, a well-known figure who has previously been the leading statewide vote-getter, coasted on Tuesday.

(256, 'Facebook and Twitter execs prepare to face grilling from Senate Intel Committee', 'Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, are scheduled to give testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday.', 'With the 2018 midterm elections less than two months away, the U.S. government wants to know what the major tech companies are doing to ensure that their platforms aren''t manipulated by foreign governments. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook''s chief operating officer, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter''s chief executive officer, are scheduled to answer questions on Wednesday from the Senate Intelligence Committee in what is the most anticipated hearing on technology since April when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified  before two Congressional committees. The committee also invited a senior executive from Google, but the company has not committed to sending Google CEO Sundar Pichai or Alphabet CEO Larry Page. Sandberg is expected to detail Facebook''s efforts to fight misinformation and manipulation, pointing out that the company has doubled the number of people it has working on safety and security, according to her written testimony. "We have more than doubled the number of people working on safety and security and now have over 20,000. We review reports in over 50 languages, 24 hours a day," Sandberg wrote in testimony provided by Facebook ahead of a Wednesday hearing with the Senate Intelligence Committee. "Better machine learning technology and artificial intelligence have also enabled us to be much more proactive in identifying abuse," the testimony said. Globally, Facebook had disabled 1.27 billion fake accounts from October 2017 to March 2018, according to the testimony. "We’re getting better at finding and combating our adversaries, from financially motivated troll farms to sophisticated military intelligence operations," Sandberg''s testimony said. Facebook knows it "can''t stop interference by ourselves," Sandberg''s testimony said. "We don’t have all the investigative tools that the government has, and we can’t always attribute attacks or identify motives." Facebook, Twitter and Google continue to face questions over just what they''re doing to stop foreign interference in upcoming elections, as well as broader questions about their efforts to minimize harassment on their platforms. The companies are also under fire from some on the right who believe the companies have shown liberal bias and are censoring conservative views. “These two companies don’t really have many public friends in Congress right now, instead on both sides they’ve got multiple partisan battles to fight," said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School''s Shorenstein Center and a former privacy and public policy advisor at Facebook. “The Senate is going to be asking some pretty serious questions of both Dorsey and Sandberg as to what exactly their current practice is, what they discovered and what they think Congress should do or the U.S. government should do going forward to more effectively police these platforms,” he added. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who is vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement to NBC News that the hearing would be focused on the future and not looking backward at election interference in the 2016 presidential election. “I’ve told the companies that I am not looking for this hearing to be a retrospective on what happened in 2016,” he said. “I want to know, one, what they’re doing to prevent this happening in 2018 and beyond; and two, I want to have a conversation about policy solutions.” Warner is planning to discuss a variety of topics beyond election interference, including the idea that users should be able to take their data to different companies, whether users should be notified if they are interacting with bots, the upside of offering more anonymized data to outside researchers in order to spot problems, and why terms of service tend to be difficult to understand, according to an excerpt from Warner''s opening statement. Twitter did not immediately reply to request for comment. Testimony released by the House of Representatives ahead of another hearing Dorsey will have in Washington on Wednesday showed the Twitter CEO planned to address censorship concerns upfront. "Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules," according to testimony Dorsey is expected to give to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. "We do not shadowban anyone based on political ideology." Google declined to confirm if it would have anyone in person at the hearing, but said Kent Walker, it''s senior vice president of global affairs and chief legal officer, will be in Washington and will deliver written testimony. In the testimony, Walker states that Google remained deeply concerned about attempts to undermine democratic elections and had rolled out several changes designed to increase transparency in election advertising and to improve election cybersecurity. The hearing comes after the Senate heard from third-party social media experts last month who said Russia and other foreign actors showed few signs of slowing their efforts to spread misinformation and propaganda, and that tech companies were not doing enough to stop those efforts. "We are constantly looking to find signals that help us identify deceptive content, while promoting content that is authoritative, relevant, and current," Walker said in the testimony. Justin Brookman, the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports, said social companies do not have the appropriate level of artificial intelligence technology or staff to combat misinformation or election interference for the massive number of users across their platforms. “They have very few content moderators historically," said Brookman, who is also a former policy director for the FTC''s Office of Technology Research and Investigation. "There’s been pressure on them to start cracking down on some of this stuff since 2016, but it’s really hard to do them at scale." “How to do you address it when it’s not that hard to set up 50,000 fake Twitter accounts and to buy lots of followers?" he said.

It’s hard, but important.” ', 'http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/facebook-twitter-execs-prepare-face-grilling-senate-intel-committee-n906301', 'https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_36/2554451/180904-sheryl-sandberg-ew-305p_46693cf3bc24b47bcbf1bf2267312b3f.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg', '2018-09-05T01:15:11.5167874Z', 268, 5),

The funding actually closed at the back end of last year, but CEO Sankaet Pathak said the company has been so busy developing new products, hiring and more than that it is only getting around to disclosing the deal now. The investment was led by Trinity Ventures  and Core Innovation Capital,  with participation from other unnamed backers. The San Francisco-based startup has sat under the radar for a while now despite starting up in 2014. Its core product is a platform that helps banks and developers work together. That involves developer-facing APIs that allow companies to connect with banks to offer services, and also bank-facing APIs that allow banks to automate and extend back-end operations. Pathak describes the vision as making it possible for anyone around the world to get access to high-quality financial products. The first focus is to make financial products “like Lego bricks” to enable banks to add new products and services easily. As it stands today, development is a painful process that requires specific infrastructure development, but SynapseFI aims to standardize a lot of the processes and platform to make things much simpler. The idea for the business came when Pathak, who moved to the U.S. from India in 2010, grew frustrated at being unable to get a bank account or loan because he had no social security history. He left the University of Memphis, where he had studied computer engineering and sciences, and founded the startup in April 2014 alongside his friend Bryan Keltner. Initially, the business focused on payments, but it gradually tilted to become a technology enabler for the financial industry. Today, SynapseFI has over 60 staff and it works with a roster of over 100 financial industry clients. Its products include the basics like payment, deposit, lending and investment services, but it has also ventured into crypto with services that include a white-label wallet. To date, it claims to have processed over $10 billion in transactions and helped bank more than 1.5 million people through its technology. “There are three core things we want to fix in banking,” Pathak told TechCrunch in an interview. “The back office is still mostly manual today and we want to automate that. There’s a need for vertical integration… we want any large or small financial company to be able to come to us and operate at the same scale as the likes of Wells and Chase. We also want to automate financial advice using behavior science.” Pathak added that the startup also harbors an ambition to expand overseas. That’s likely to mean Europe first — potentially a market like the UK or Germany — but it’ll require fairly intensive localization as the SynapseFI platform is customized to accommodate U.S. APIs and data pipes, none of which will work outside of the country. An expansion would be likely to happen around the time that the company looks to raise its Series B, although Pathak stressed that he is also focused on building a sustainable business and not simply relying on venture capital money. Indeed, he said that the company is likely to reach breakeven by the end of the year. “I still think it’s a healthy business practice,” Pathak said.

The discussions for a possible presidential interview are continuing. The focus of the letter was an emphasis on written questions for the President, according to one source. Another source said Mueller''s letter stated the written responses would pertain to questions regarding potential conspiring between Trump associates and Russia. The response left unresolved the issue of an in-person interview and questions regarding Trump''s time in office, the source added. The response was received on Friday, three-and-a-half weeks after the President''s lawyers submitted their last offer. Trump''s team hasn''t responded to the latest Mueller proposal. The news of the Mueller team''s response comes the same day as excerpts from political reporter Bob Woodward''s latest book, "Fear: Trump in the White House," became public. In the book, Woodward describes a mock interview Trump did with his legal team, in which they hoped to prove to the President that he shouldn''t sit down with Mueller''s team for an interview. Trump''s lawyer at the time, John Dowd, viewed the interview as a disaster. According to Woodward, Trump seemed surprised by Dowd''s reaction and asked, "You think I was struggling?" The Trump legal team''s position has been that any sit-down interview has to be limited to matters before Trump became President, and for questions related to possible obstruction and other post-inauguration matters to be done in writing. While Trump''s lawyers have been against an interview, and the President has sounded less agreeable to talking lately, neither side has been willing to end the discussion. On Tuesday, the President called the Mueller investigation "illegal" in an interview with the Daily Caller. In mid-August, the President called Mueller "highly conflicted" and said "let him write his report." Should the President refuse, Mueller could seek a subpoena to compel him to talk. That''s an effort that could lead to a Supreme Court challenge by the White House. The Trump legal team view is that Mueller would be less likely to succeed in subpoenaing over issues of obstruction given executive privilege issues, for example, when it comes to the President''s discussions with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about the firing of Comey, according to another source.

Bob Woodward''s upcoming book offers new insights into President Donald Trump''s anger over advisers'' efforts to clean up his explosive "both sides" remark on the violence last year at a white supremacist rally in …', '(CNN)WARNING: This story contains graphic language. Bob Woodward''s upcoming book offers new insights into President Donald Trump''s anger over advisers'' efforts to clean up his explosive "both sides" remark on the violence last year at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author''s new book, "Fear: Trump in the White House," is being released September 11. CNN obtained a copy. Trump''s August 2017 remarks concluding there was "blame on both sides" for the violence was a stunning moment early in his presidency that ignited a backlash over his views on race and consumed the White House for days. The new revelations may reopen that debate. In the book, Woodward describes how then-White House staff secretary Rob Porter worked with Trump to write a second speech to try to repair his initial comments about violence at the marches. Porter tried to convince the President he needed to clarify his remarks. But Trump appeared to resist, according to the book, repeatedly saying: "I don''t know about this. ... This doesn''t feel right to me." Eventually, Trump agreed, and two days later in a televised speech he denounced racism, the "KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups." Woodward describes how White House aides were relieved, and chief of staff John Kelly encouraged staff to tell the President what a good job he did. One Fox News commentator gave Trump praise but also added, "That''s almost an admission of ''Okay, I was wrong.''" Then Fox News correspondent Kevin Corke said: "Some 48 hours into the biggest domestic challenge of his young presidency, Mr. Trump has made a course correction." Trump exploded at the coverage, Woodward reports. "That was the biggest fucking mistake I''ve made," the President told Porter. "You never make those concessions. You never apologize. I didn''t do anything wrong in the first place. Why look weak?" Trump continued venting to Porter, Woodward writes. "I can''t believe I got forced to do that," he said. "That''s the worst speech I''ve ever given. I''m never going to do anything like that again." One day later, Trump spoke at an unrelated Trump Tower event, where he surprised his staff and doubled down on his original sentiment that "both sides" were to blame for the violence, equating white supremacists with what he termed the "alt-left." "You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent," Trump said. "Nobody wants to say it, but I will say it right now." Porter was shocked, Woodward writes, and told Trump he thought the second speech was the only good one. "I don''t want to talk to you," Trump responded. "Get away from me." The White House accused Woodward on Tuesday of spreading "fabricated stories" about Trump but did not rebut any of the specific claims in the book about Charlottesville. "This book is nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the President look bad," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. "While it is not always pretty, and rare that the press actually covers it, President Trump has broken through the bureaucratic process to deliver unprecedented successes for the American people. Sometimes it is unconventional, but he always gets results." Woodward''s book relies on hundreds of hours of taped confidential background interviews and dozens of sources in Trump''s inner circle, as well as documents, files, diaries and memos, including a note handwritten by Trump himself. Woodward''s reporting comes with a credibility that separates this book from previous efforts on Trump. The author and Washington Post journalist has won two Pulitzer Prizes, including one for his coverage of the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon''s resignation. The book describes a scene in the Oval Office in which then-chief economic adviser Gary Cohn tried to resign in response to Trump''s comments. Trump berated Cohn, blamed his wife and "liberal Park Avenue friends," and told him: "This is treason." Cohn eventually agreed to stay to help pass a sweeping tax bill. Kelly, who witnessed the exchange, praised the economic adviser''s self-control. "If that was me, I would have taken the resignation letter and shoved it up his ass six different times," Kelly told Cohn, according to notes Cohn made of the encounter, as reported by Woodward. The book describes the aftermath of Charlottesville as a turning point for many in the White House. Woodward reports that Kelly told then-White House chief strategist Steve Bannon he was afraid a third of the Cabinet could resign because "this thing''s on a knife''s edge ... people are not going to tolerate it." But Trump''s team largely fell in line -- there were no major resignations in the wake of Charlottesville.

For a thorough preview, you can catch Facebook and Twitter’s opening statements. In the Senate hearing, expect most of the discussion to focus on the company’s efforts to thwart coordinated efforts by US adversaries to influence domestic politics.

Instead of Larry Page, Google sends written testimony to tech’s Senate hearing As the name suggests, the conversation will likely center on social media disinformation campaigns in relation to the upcoming US midterm elections and the cybersecurity efforts made to detect and prevent them.

In a press release, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. Greg Walden described the decision to call on Dorsey: “This hearing is about transparency, accountability, and action. We want to take complex, opaque algorithms out of the dark and shed light on the role they play in consumers’ lives. We want to better understand the decisions Twitter makes about content and the company’s process to prevent mistakes and undue bias.

Chris Fallon, an attorney representing homeless veteran Johnny Bobbitt Jr., told NBC Philadelphia  that he learned the more than $402,000 that was raised is gone in a conference call with attorneys for the couple who headed the campaign last year, Katie McClure and her boyfriend, Mark D''Amico. "Shock. I was shocked and just appalled," another of Bobbitt''s attorneys, Jacqueline Promislo, who was on the conference call, said in a phone interview with NBC News later Tuesday. She said there was no explanation about the money, other than that they were told "there was no money transferred because there was no money left," and that "it was not up for interpretation." The couple''s attorney, Ernest E. Badway, in an email declined to comment to NBC News. The initially heartwarming tale that began when Bobbitt gave McClure his last $20 when she ran out of gas on a freeway exit ramp last November outside Philadelphia turned into a legal dispute in late August when attorneys for Bobbitt filed a lawsuit to try and force the couple to turn over whatever was left of the money that was raised. On Thursday a New Jersey judge ordered McClure and D’Amico to turn over whatever was left. In an interview with NBC''s "Megyn Kelly Today" last week, the couple said that they did not use any of the money that was raised, but they also said they believed there could be as little as $150,000 left after they said Bobbitt spent money on family, a trailer, truck and drugs. They said that they set up an account for Bobbitt but not with all of the money, because they were worried that he would spend it on drugs. "We saw the pattern that was developing ... that he was going to do something foolish, and end up right back where he was," D''Amico told Kelly. The couple claimed Bobbitt went through $25,000 in 13 days. In court documents filed by Bobbitt''s attorneys, the couple was accused of using "substantial portions of the money raised for their own personal use.” Promislo said that Bobbitt has said that, including a truck and camper which the couple bought but was never in Bobbitt’s name, about $75,000 has been disbursed from the over $400,000 fund. The truck and camper were later sold by the couple, the lawyer said. In court last week, Badway said that Bobbitt had received at least $200,000 of the funds, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Last week, the judge who ordered them to turn over the remainder of the money said that the couple must give the money to their defense lawyer, who was directed to place funds into an escrow account as the case continues, NBC Philadelphia reported. The judge also ordered McClure and D''Amico to provide a full accounting of the money they raised. Promislo said that Bobbitt is currently homeless and focusing on getting into rehab.

(265, 'UK economy requires fundamental structural shift, says landmark think tank report', 'The Institute for Public Policy Research’s Commission on Economic Justice, has been analysing every aspects of the UK economy since the autumn of 2016', 'The UK economy requires a series of fundamental structural overhauls – from giving workers more rights, to raising state investment, to empowering regulators to bust monopolies – a landmark commission on the state of the UK economy has concluded. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s Commission on Economic Justice, which has been analysing every aspects of the UK economy for the past 18 months, also argues in its final report that it is necessary to “hard-wire” justice into our economic system, rather than treating this as “an afterthought”. The Commission’s interim report last year argued that reforms on the scale of the founding of the state in the 1940s by Labour and the wrenching Thatcher reforms of the 1980s were necessary. The final document fleshes out that manifesto, recommending five major “shifts”: “In each of these ways, the UK economy needs to be reshaped if we are to achieve prosperity and justice together”, the report argues. “And change must happen on a sufficient scale to achieve ‘escape velocity’ from the economy we have today to the one we need.” The Commission met 10 times over the past year and a half. Its members include Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, Dominic Barton, the boss of the management consultancy firm McKinsey, Lord Kerslake, the former head of the home civil service, the Brexit-supporting businessman John Mills and the Trade Union Congress general secretary Frances O’Grady. The Commission was politically independent and takes no view on Brexit. Nor does it seek to attribute political blame for the economic condition of the UK now. It steers clear of the fraught subject of utility re-nationalisation, part of Labour’s manifesto, although it does, like the opposition, propose a National Investment Bank. It calls for a “serious debate” about the level of taxes as a share of GDP, without recommending its own target, but it does say income and wealth should be “taxed in the same way”. The Commission says the Bank of England’s mandate should be expanded from price stability to also include a target for minimising unemployment, underemployment, and also the level of nominal GDP. It argues the Bank should be given the power to ask the new National Investment Bank to expand lending, to stimulate aggregate demand, when its own interest rates can go no lower. It calls for public investment to be increased by 0.8 per cent of GDP on top of current plans. On immigration, it suggests dropping the government’s net annual aggregate target, but replacing it with a series of sectoral targets. It proposes a “National Economic Council”, headed by the Chancellor and involving devolved UK regional administrations, business leaders and trade unions to create a “co-ordinated 10-year plan for the UK economy”. The package of measures would certainly constitute a new direction for the UK, taking it closer to a European-style co-ordinated market economy like Germany and away from the current liberal model. The report takes comfort from the fact that the UK economic model was previously radically shaken up in the 1940s and 1980s​. “It is precisely because we have achieved change of this magnitude before that we believe it is possible to do so again,” it says. “We can bridge the gap between the country we are and the country we would like to be,” says the IPPR’s director Tom Kibasi.

She is a professor at Harvard''s Kennedy School, a former assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration and CEO of Zemcar. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)Bob Woodward''s new book, "Fear," is the story of an unstable President and a chaotic White House. In the run-up to its publication next Tuesday and beyond, expect much debate, blame, denials, pontifications, and tweets (definitely, tweets) either refuting or supporting what the book offers as evidence. That is accounts from President Donald Trump''s own staff that he is unable to grasp policy, is endangering the country and unwilling to acknowledge the depth of his legal vulnerabilities. This is the story of President Trump. It is the story of the White House. The passages released so far are not just about the content of private discussions or the substantive debates over national and homeland security. They describe internal processes that are so dysfunctional, so mercurial, so back-stabbing and destructive that other nations and their leaders -- whether ally or enemy -- will see in them more proof of an unreliable partner. That partner is us. It isn''t that revelations about Trump''s personality will be surprising to leaders in Europe, South America, the Middle East or China. They have met him. They have read the tweets. What is new in Woodward''s book is the picture of a President utterly isolated from the very people who serve him in the White House. The President is in a den of vipers shot through with a cadre of aides trying to save the world from a crisis, according to the book (and since the start of his presidency, we''ve seen little reason to doubt it). The President has lost the authority that matters to us as a nation. Put it this way: does Trump seem weaker or stronger after these stories have come out? Whatever your answer, it''s the same answer for the United States. Our President cannot control a narrative of American superiority when he has lost control of that narrative. If our allies want a reliable partner, they will look to each other or another heavyweight like China. Beyond our capacity to support friends, America looks -- and therefore is -- more vulnerable because of how the President has managed his office. A recent case in point: the response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico was ultimately about a White House that refused to comprehend the magnitude of the disaster, lead when the threat was real, or take responsibility for a population that lacked potable water and electricity -- and a death toll that would be revised upward last week to nearly 3,000. His response to that news -- that the US did a "fantastic job"-- falls, like a heartless joke, on the ears of those who lost family, home, livelihood. It was also quite a terrifying response, as it showed that he simply missed the gravity of the situation. A President unable to recognize harms coming our way, and to deploy resources to stop them, energizes our enemies. Finally, as someone who worked in an administration agency, I can tell you how revelations like those in Woodward''s book play in the halls of power in America and across the world: workers in federal agencies that protect our national security are left with little to support their efforts against the unavoidable conclusion that the lights are not on at the White House. This can be very dangerous; agencies get their strength and authority by positioning themselves as aligned with the White House and the President.  For US officials, a meeting with a foreign diplomat or an urban mayor about safety and security draws legitimacy from the backing of the White House.   It works the way a "trump card" should. Those who work outside the White House, and who are protected by a government that is functional, are also hidden characters in Woodward''s book. They are not anonymous sources or former Trump advisers. They are ... us. The book is about the fate of the United States.

(267, 'UK railways: Theresa May ''considering major review into future of network'' as anger at disruption grows', 'Tories may hope probe will help them oppose calls for nationalising train system', 'Theresa May is considering commissioning a major review into the future of Britain’s railways amid growing anger with the performance of the network. It is understood that Downing Street is contemplating whether an overall inquiry would prove more effective than looking separately at issues such as franchising, fares and timetabling. No decision has been made but it is believed that such a move would be supported by transport secretary Chris Grayling. The Conservatives may hope a rail review will help them oppose calls for returning operation of trains back into public control, which is a key Labour policy. Mr Grayling was forced to refute accusations from Labour and trade unions that his decision to end the Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC) franchise early was a “bailout” worth £2bn. VTEC, a joint venture between Stagecoach (90 per cent) and Virgin (10 per cent), began operating in March 2015. The firms agreed to pay the government £3.3bn to run trains until 2023, but the contract was ended prematurely after they failed to achieve revenue targets. A report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee in April found that passengers are paying the price for the “broken model” of rail franchising. The committee claimed the Department for Transport had “failed to learn the lessons from previous failings” on the East Coast route. The government also came under fire after it emerged that rail commuters face an increase of up to 3.2 per cent in the cost of season tickets next year. Passenger groups, unions and politicians reacted with anger after the cap on regulated fare rises was confirmed last month. Mr Grayling warned that a lower inflation measure can only be used to set fare increases if it is also used to calculate pay rises on the railway. There have been calls for fares to be frozen following chaos caused by the implementation of new timetables. Chaos ensued after many train times were changed on 20 May, with passengers in the north and southeast of England suffering delays and cancellations for several weeks. A series of failures have been blamed, including Network Rail’s late approval of the timetables and delayed electrification projects in the north, poor planning by train operators, and the decision by transport ministers to phase in the introduction of new Govia Thameslink Railway services. The Department for Transport said in a statement: “Privatisation has helped transform our railway – doubling passenger numbers and delivering more services, extra investment and new trains. “We are absolutely committed to improving journeys and are always examining ways to improve how the railway serves passengers.” The prospect of a review was welcomed by Paul Plummer, chief executive of industry body the Rail Delivery Group. He said: “We have been saying that the time is right for root and branch reform of the railway and any review must leave no stone unturned. It must be all-encompassing, considering franchising, Network Rail and the role of other rail organisations.” But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald warned that passengers do not need a review to explain to them that the franchising system is “broken beyond repair”. He went on: “I can tell the prime minister now that no amount of tinkering will change the fact that rail franchising has failed, does not deliver and never will.” ', 'http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-rail-trains-disruption-major-review-price-hike-delays-latest-a8523171.html', 'https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/15/08/northernrailmanchesterpiccadilly7.jpg', '2018-09-04T23:10:54Z', 278, 6),

The Greater Manchester mayor believes the Article 50 negotiation period should be extended beyond March 2019 as a contingency measure if the only alternative was a no-deal Brexit. The Labour former Cabinet minister also suggests a second referendum could be required if no agreement is reached between the UK and Brussels. Mr Burnham will use a major speech in Westminster to set out his plan, insisting “this isn’t about frustrating Brexit” but instead about “getting Brexit right”. He acknowledges that another referendum – as demanded by the People’s Vote campaign – could result in further divisions in society. But he will say that it could be necessary to protect people’s livelihoods from a no-deal Brexit. The Independent has launched a petition for a Final Say vote, which has been signed by almost 750,000 people. He will call for a “commonsense Brexit” based on “building up” from Theresa May’s Chequers plan. But he acknowledges that disputes at Westminster mean this approach is looking “more and more unlikely” and “the odds on a no-deal outcome are growing every day”. That would be a “disaster” for Greater Manchester, he will say, as he calls for a cross-party approach to preventing a no-deal scenario. “As soon as it becomes clear that the MPs against a no-deal outcome cannot unite around a plan, I would urge all Greater Manchester MPs to support a call on the EU for an extension of Article 50 beyond the March deadline as the next way of stopping no deal,” he will say. “This isn’t about frustrating Brexit. It is about getting Brexit right. “If that fails and we are left on the cliff-edge of no deal with no other options, then and only then would I endorse the call for a people’s vote on the proposed no-deal departure and encourage our MPs to do the same. “A price would undoubtedly be paid in terms of social cohesion but it would be a necessary one to protect the damage to people’s jobs, families and lives. “I realise that this is an unfashionably nuanced position when simplistic big positions are all the rage.” Mr Burnham will argue that the result of the 201 6 referendum was “as much an instruction for Westminster to review its relationship with the rest of England” as Brussels. “If the phrase ‘take back control’ is to mean anything, it must mean substantial devolution of power and resources out of Westminster to all of the English regions,” he will say.

The re…', 'Facebook’s  chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has admitted that the social networking giant could have done more to prevent foreign interference on its platforms, but said that the government also needs to step up its intelligence sharing efforts. The remarks are ahead of an open hearing at the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, where Sandberg and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey will testify on foreign interference and election meddling on social media platforms. Google’s Larry Page was invited, but declined to attend. “We were too slow to spot this and too slow to act,” said Sandberg in prepared remarks. “That’s on us.” The hearing comes in the aftermath of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Social media companies have been increasingly under the spotlight after foreign actors, believed to be working for or closely to the Russian government, used disinformation spreading tactics to try to influence the outcome of the election, as well as in the run-up to the midterm elections later this year. Both Facebook and Twitter have removed accounts and bots from their sites believed to be involved in spreading disinformation and false news. Google said last year that it found Russian meddling efforts on its platforms. “We’re getting better at finding and combating our adversaries, from financially motivated troll farms to sophisticated military intelligence operations,” said Sandberg. But Facebook’s second-in-command also said that the US government could do more to help companies understand the wider picture from Russian interference. “We continue to monitor our service for abuse and share information with law enforcement and others in our industry about these threats,” she said. “Our understanding of overall Russian activity in 2016 is limited because we do not have access to the information or investigative tools that the U.S. government and this Committee have,” she said. Later, Twitter’s  Dorsey also said in his own statement: “The threat we face requires extensive partnership and collaboration with our government partners and industry peers,” adding: “We each possess information the other does not have, and the combined information is more powerful in combating these threats.” Both Sandberg and Dorsey are subtly referring to classified information that the government has but private companies don’t get to see — information that is considered a state secret. Tech companies have in recent years pushed for more access to knowledge that federal agencies have, not least to help protect against increasing cybersecurity threats and hostile nation state actors. The theory goes that the idea of sharing intelligence can help companies defend against the best resourced hackers. But efforts to introduce legislation has proven controversial because critics argue that in sharing threat information with the government private user data would also be collected and sent to US intelligence agencies for further investigation. Instead, tech companies are now pushing for information from Homeland Security to better understand the threats they face — to independently fend off future attacks. As reported, tech companies last month met in secret to discuss preparations to counter foreign manipulation on their platforms. But attendees, including Facebook, Twitter, and Google and Microsoft are said to have “left the meeting discouraged” that they received little insight from the government.

(271, 'Watchdog: Communication breakdown delayed review of Cuba health ''attacks''', 'A communications breakdown in the State Department delayed creation of a special panel to assess the response to mysterious health "attacks" on U.S. diplomats.', 'WASHINGTON — A communications breakdown within the State Department delayed by more than half a year the creation of a special panel to assess the response to mysterious health "attacks" on U.S. diplomats that led to brain injury, according to a report from congressional investigators obtained by NBC News. The Government Accountability Office report, which has not been publicly released, determined that the unit of the State Department responsible for setting up the special panel first learned of the incidents from reports in the media in August 2017. That was eight months after the medical staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana started evaluating U.S. government workers who reported incidents. The State Department’s medical unit, Western Hemisphere Affairs bureau and Diplomatic Security service were all aware of what was happening but failed to inform the State Department management office responsible for initiating the establishment of an accountability review board. In the meantime, 80 workers were medically evaluated and 16 found to have brain injuries. More were discovered later, including after new incidents were reported. By law, the board must be set up within 60 days of an incident that seriously injures a diplomat abroad. Its mandate is to look into whether the government responded appropriately. Examples of past high-profile review boards include the one that investigated the U.S. response to the attacks in 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans. Congressional investigators determined that the State Department currently has "no policy" in place to ensure that information flows to the management office that starts the process of setting up the board. The State Department agreed with that conclusion and pledged to make improvements, the GAO report said. The State Department declined to comment because the congressional report hasn’t been made public. The new report comes as concern about the incidents, deemed "specific attacks" by the State Department, has increased after a U.S. diplomat working in China was determined to have also been injured by a similar phenomenon and developed a brain injury. "Improving its security programs at U.S. diplomatic posts is all the more imperative given recent reports of similar incidents, such as in Guangzhou, China," the report said, referring to the State Department. Ultimately, the accountability review board for Cuba was established in January 2018 — more than a year after the incidents started. In a summary of its findings released last week, the board determined that no State Department workers acted improperly, but identified similar problems with internal communication, as well as unfilled security positions and a lack of sufficient planning for the diplomats’ long-term care. The delays in fully responding to the incidents are expected to be a focus on Thursday when State Department officials testify before the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s subcommittee for the Western Hemisphere. Rep. Paul Cook, R-Calif., who chairs the Western Hemisphere panel, said the report illustrated how "policy, procedure, process, and communications issues prevented a more effective State Department response." Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., a staunch critic of Cuba’s government who requested the congressional report, said the communications breakdown also significantly delayed the State Department in raising the incidents with the Cuban government. "The truth about these incidents will come to light and the United States stands ready to hold accountable those responsible for attacking our citizens," Ros-Lehtinen said. Bizarre sounds heard by the workers initially led investigators to suspect a sonic weapon, although signs now point to a microwave device or electromagnetic waves as the likely cause, NBC News has reported. The congressional report says that as of June, when the report was being written, "State officials remained uncertain of the cause or perpetrator of the incidents and injuries."

All of this is salacious. And makes for great headlines. But what''s truly worrisome for President Trump and his administration is that the portrait Woodward paints of a chaotic, dysfunctional, ill-prepared White House is all strangely familiar. It''s the same vision of the White House that Michael Wolff wrote way back in January in "Fire and Fury." It''s the same picture that Omarosa Manigault-Newman constructed in her memoir of her year in the White House. It''s the same story that White House reporters at CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and virtually every other mainstream media outlet has told of the Trump White House.

Sure, Michael Wolff could have been misled by a few sources with scores to settle with Trump. Sure, reporters could get a detail or two wrong. Sure, Woodward could have cast a scene or two in ways that are less than favorable to Trump. But how could all -- and I mean all -- of the reporting on this White House reach a striking similar conclusion? The portraits of Trump drawn by Wolff, Omarosa and Woodward are all eerily similar to one another -- a man hopelessly out of his depth in the job, but entirely incapable of understanding how desperately out of depth he actually is. A man motivated almost entirely by personal grievance. A man willing to humiliate people who work for him, to play staffers against one another, to scapegoat underlings to keep blame off of himself. Someone who has so much self-belief that he rarely adequately prepares for situations involving international diplomacy and national security.

Democrats spent much of the hearing frustrated about what they called a lack of transparency around the nomination, accusing the White House of over-classifying documents to keep them out of the public light and expressing frustration about the last-minute release on Monday night of tens of thousands of additional documents related to Kavanaugh’s time in the George W. Bush White House. Republicans defended the process, arguing that Democratic complaints amounted to playing politics and that Kavanaugh''s judicial record was far more important than the shielded White House documents.

Here are some of the most memorable moments from the day-long hearing: The fireworks began just moments after Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called the hearing to order, kicking off a flurry of Democratic objections. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., immediately interrupted Grassley to criticize the last-minute document release, which turned into a snowballing of other Democratic objections. "The committee just received just last night less than 15 hours ago 42,000 pages of documents that we have not had an opportunity to review or read or analyze," she said. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., repeatedly called for the panel to adjourn the hearing to give senators time to read those new documents, as he and his fellow Democrats cast the process as rushed and illegitimate. Grassley dismissed the calls as Democratic objections delayed opening statements for more than an hour, at one point asking in frustration just how long they planned to keep raising complaints. Protesters remained a constant fixture of the hearing throughout the day, with Capitol Police repeatedly kicking out people who stood up and began shouting. By 10:19 a.m., 22 people had already been arrested, with more escorted out throughout the day.

Leahy asks Chairman Grassley of Kavanaugh documents that have yet to be produced to the committee. pic.twitter.com/iUIWh3YCg6 More than half an hour into the Democratic dissent, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., began to question their motives, pointing to NBC reporting about the party''s coordinated strategy. Reading a tweet from NBC News''s Kasie Hunt aloud on the floor, Tillis suggested that Democrats were protesting not because of the late release of the documents, but for political gain. Democrats plotted coordinated protest strategy over the holiday weekend and all agreed to disrupt and protest the hearing, sources tell me and @frankthorp Dem leader @chuckschumer led a phone call and committee members are executing now "I''m confused because I heard earlier this was a reaction to the document releases last night," Tillis said. "I want to be clear, no members participated in the strategy before the documents were released yesterday? Are you suggesting this allegation is false?" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., confirmed the reporting but argued that their frustration stems from the secrecy surrounding many documents related to Kavanaugh''s time in the White House. Soon after, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, described the repeated Democratic objections and protester interruptions as a descent into "mob rule." He raised frustration with Democratic senators who had already announced they wouldn''t support Kavanaugh before Tuesday''s hearing, questioning whether he should entertain their concerns. If the hearing were a court of law, he said, Democrats "would be held in contempt." "I haven''t been in as many confirmation hearings as some of my colleagues, but this is the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court Justice nominee I''ve seen courting the mob rule," Cornyn said. "It is hard to take seriously their claim that, somehow, they can''t do their job because they''ve been denied access to attorney-client or executive privilege documents, when they''ve already made up their mind before the hearing." Democrats have fretted that Kavanaugh would weaken the landmark Roe v. Wade law that established a legal right to an abortion. While Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has previously said Kavanaugh told her Roe v. Wade is "settled law," Democrats say they still fear he could weaken abortion rights from the bench. "The president that nominated you has said: ''I will nominate someone who is anti-choice and pro-gun,''" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. "We cannot find the documents that absolve from that conclusion, so what women have won through Roe and a host of privacy cases — to be able to control their own reproductive systems, to have basic privacy rights — [is] really extraordinarily important to this side of the aisle." Fighting to get his words in as hecklers attempted to shout over him, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, lamented that outside groups are "putting pressure on my Democratic colleagues to make this hearing about politics." And he questioned the motivations of Democrats challenging committee leadership. "We have folks who want to run for president, who want their moment in the spotlight, who want that coveted TV clip," he said. "Judge Kavanaugh is unquestionably qualified," he added. "Anyone who wants to argue otherwise wants to banish half the country from the mainstream." Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sen. Kamala Harris are among those viewed as potential White House contenders in 2020. Just before noon, Durbin made a direct appeal to Kavanaugh to join Democratic calls for a delay, arguing that his words would help legitimize the process. "There are many people are watching carefully. I''m going to make a suggestion to you today and it won''t be popular on the other side of the aisle," he said. "If you believe your public record is one you can stand behind and defend, I hope at the end of this, you will ask this committee to suspend until we are given all the documents, until we have the time to review them and then we resume this hearing." Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz framed the Democratic laments over Kavanaugh as playing politics. "It''s not about documents, it''s not about qualifications, it''s not about record. What it is about is politics — it is about Democratic senators trying to relitigate the 2016 election and, just as importantly, working to begin litigating the 2020 election," he said. "But we had an opportunity for the American people to speak, they did, they voted in 2016 and they wanted judges and justices who will be faithful to the Constitution." A father of a teenage girl killed in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. earlier this year unsuccessfully attempted to shake Kavanaugh''s hand during a break in the hearing, with the nominee walking away from him. White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah, who is one of the administration''s point-people on the nomination, tweeted shortly after that security had "intervened" because it didn''t know who the man was approaching the judge. The New Jersey senator highlighted another major Democratic line of attack on Kavanaugh: that President Donald Trump could soon be looking to his nominee for a legal lifeline, with the judge added to the list of potential high court nominees "after the president was in jeopardy." "The president pulled the one person from all of that list that was added late, that would give him in a sense the ability to pick a judge that has already spoken vastly about a president''s ability to dismiss or end an investigation," Booker added.

(274, 'Tropical Storm Gordon heads for landfall along Mississippi coast', 'Gordon, still just below hurricane strength, was expected to hit near Gulfport, Mississippi, on Tuesday night.', 'Already blamed for at least one death, the center of Tropical Storm Gordon made landfall on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday night with fierce winds, heavy rain and the potential for life-threatening storm surges. Gordon, which remained just below Category 1 hurricane strength, crossed land just west of the Alabama-Mississippi border at about 11:15 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said. Gordon''s top sustained winds remained at 70 mph, with tropical storm-force winds extending 80 miles from the center. As the storm''s outer winds whipped over the Gulf Coast at around 8:50 p.m. (9:50 p.m. ET), a tree was blown over onto a mobile home in Pensacola in the western Panhandle of Florida, killing a child, the Escambia County Sheriff''s Office said. It is believed to be the first death attributable to the storm. The child''s identity wasn''t released. A spokeswoman for the sheriff''s office said the rest of the child''s family escaped unharmed. A hurricane warning remained in effect from the mouth of the Pearl River, which divides Louisiana and Mississippi, to the Alabama-Florida border. At 12:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, almost 42,000 customers were without power in Baldwin and Mobile counties in Alabama, Escambia County in Florida and Jackson County in Mississippi, utilities reported. "You are talking tropical storm winds coming ashore. You''re looking at the saturated ground. Trees are coming down. Long-term power outages could be for some time," said Greg Michel, director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. The Mississippi cities of Gulfport, Long Beach and Biloxi ordered mandatory evacuations of their harbors and marinas, and the U.S. Coast Guard temporarily closed the ports of New Orleans; Mobile, Alabama; and Pascagoula, Mississippi. The Cajun Navy, the volunteer collection of Louisiana boaters who flock to tropical storms and hurricanes to lend assistance, made its way to Gulfport. "They''re our neighbors, and we know what happens with the different terrains and what to expect," Clyde Cain, a Cajun Navy volunteer, told NBC station WDSU of New Orleans. "So we''re here to back up the first responders and be on call." Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said his state would likely miss the worst of the storm, but he encouraged residents to remain vigilant and prepared. He issued a state of emergency and authorized the activation of 200 National Guardsmen to be positioned in southeastern Louisiana. "We still have some nasty weather headed our way," Edwards told reporters, adding that the state could expect winds of 40 mph to 70 mph. "We''re not out of the woods." "We are going to always prepare for the worst and pray for the best," Guy McInnis, the president of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana — the equivalent of a county manager — told WDSU as dozens of boaters and fishers cleared out of Shell Beach. Gordon was moving northwest at 14 mph and should weaken rapidly as it heads inland, but it''s expected to produce rainfall of 4 to 8 inches from the western Florida Panhandle to southern Arkansas, through Thursday night, with isolated maximums of a foot, the hurricane center said. The town of Bayou La Batre, in Mobile County, Alabama, was one of many coastal municipalities that issued voluntary evacuation advisories as Gordon approached. "A lot of folks live in the low-land areas, and we don''t want anyone getting caught up in that," Mayor Terry Downey told NBC affiliate WPMI of Mobile. "They need to know that with the surge coming, they could be trapped." Had Gordon become a hurricane, it would have been the first Atlantic hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Nate last October. Nate had weakened sharply by time it hit the mouth of the Mississippi River, and Ray Coleman, a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, warned residents not to get complacent. "My worry is that people might get hurricane amnesia, where they feel like, ''Oh, last year wasn''t so bad,''" Coleman told NBC affiliate WLBT of Jackson. "My thing is, no two storms are alike. Just because you made it through Hurricane Nate last year doesn''t mean that this one will be the same." 15 foot waves offshore from Perdido, Alabama.

Early projections showed Florence — the third hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season — weakening as it headed north, and no hazards to land were expected, the National Hurricane Center said.

He pulled his hand back, turned his back to me and walked away.

(276, 'FBI Director Christopher Wray becomes the latest target for Trump''s ire', 'President Trump has added FBI Director Christopher Wray to his list of complaints about key members of his administration, NBC News has learned.', 'WASHINGTON — In recent conversations with confidants, President Donald Trump has added FBI Director Christopher Wray to his list of key members of his administration whom he complains about, three people familiar with the discussions tell NBC News. Trump has criticized Wray as another figure in the Justice Department who is not protecting his interests — and is possibly out to undermine his presidency, these people said. Trump is "in the worst mood of his presidency and calling friends and allies to vent about his selection of (Attorney General Jeff) Sessions and Wray," said one person familiar with the president’s thinking. This person said the president was particularly focused on both men over the Labor Day weekend. Trump has frequently tweeted about the Russia probe and more than once has criticized the Justice Department, the FBI and Sessions by name. But until now, the president has been cautious about publicly criticizing the person he appointed after firing former FBI Director James Comey. Now he’s increasingly grouping Wray with Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the special counsel’s Russia investigation, all subjects of relentless criticism from the president. Trump nominated Wray for the FBI post last summer, weeks after the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller and months after Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation. Since then, Wray has largely avoided the president’s public ire. While Trump has criticized the FBI generally, saying the bureau is biased against him, he has not gone after Wray personally. That has changed, the people familiar with the president’s thinking said, as Trump’s frustration with his Justice Department has escalated. He’s pointed to issues such as the resistance by the FBI to turn over documents to congressional Republicans. The FBI declined to comment for this story. NBC News has reached out to the White House for comment. Wray has defended the FBI against Trump’s attacks. In December, after Trump said the FBI’s reputation was in "tatters," Wray pushed back publicly. "The FBI that I see is tens of thousands of agents and analysts and staff working their tails off to keep Americans safe from the next terrorist attack, gang violence, child predators, spies from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran," he said during a congressional hearing. Trump has at times been wound up by Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative advocacy group Judicial Watch, and a regular commentator on Fox News, who has been sharply critical of Wray and what he describes as corruption at the FBI. Wray has reportedly threatened to resign at least once over potential pressure from the president to fire his then-deputy Andrew McCabe. Asked in July by NBC’s Lester Holt whether he’d ever reached a point where a line had been crossed and he threatened to resign, Wray did not deny he had. "I''m a low-key, understated guy, but that should not be mistaken for what my spine is made out of. I''ll just leave it at that," Wray said.

(278, 'The revival of French electro-pop', 'French in tone and in tongue, a new generation of musicians is nevertheless finding success abroad', 'IN THE hazy late-July sun, festival-goers at Biarritz en été meandered to the main stage. Their ankles were flecked with mud; their stomachs were full of Toulousian fare. But the hypnotic melodies and beats of “Aqualand” by Polo & Pan, a French electronic duo, proved compelling: transfixed and transported to imaginary lands, the audience swayed with ease. Call it “electro-pop” or just plain pop; it hardly matters. Musicians vow their music is genreless, yet many speak of the same “tropical” feel or “cosmic vibe”—a light sound where groove takes centre stage. Artists experiment with synths and strings, and reference a host of other sub-genres such as Brazilian house and Trap, a type of hip-hop. They embrace and rework the cheesy chansons of their parents’ generation. Themes of a carefree existence recur. Listeners the world over are duly taking note. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. The music is a product of the “new wave of creativity” spreading across France, says Armand Bultheel, one half of Agar Agar. While Bordeaux is a hotspot for up-and-coming garage musicians and Lyon is a haven for electronic purists, electro-pop is mostly a Parisian phenomenon. The capital’s artistic crowd and close-knit musical community—so close that some French folk bemoan it is really just a gaggle of wealthy “Versailles kids”—makes it the ideal “meeting point” for musicians interested in this kind of experimentation, notes Mr Bultheel. For Julian Catala, the organiser of Biarritz’s festival, it is “French touch 2.0”. That term was originally applied to the group of artists such as Daft Punk and Air who made their name in the early 2000s. They not only created a new sound—layering disco classics with house beats and the rhythms of 1980s American groove—but breathed life into an otherwise outdated and outshined French music scene. They then transported their sound across continents: Daft Punk’s cosmic outfits became instantly recognisable, showing that the French still had that musical je ne sais quoi. These musicians are French in tone and in tongue: singing in their native language is increasingly the norm rather than the exception. Most are chic bands taking inspiration from French lyricists such as Françoise Hardy, or local rap artists that top the streaming charts in the country. So far this year, only one non-French artist, Ed Sheeran, made the top 20 according to SNEP, a trade body. That Anglophone audiences might struggle to understand their songs is of little concern to most musicians: even Frenchmen will miss most of the lyrics says Charles de Boisseguin, a member of L’Imperatrice, an electro-pop sextet (pictured). Their words delight in double meanings and fantastical imagery because really “what matters is the melody and the way it makes you groove”. Julia Jean-Baptiste, the lead singer of Pendentif, another such band, agrees: her group adjusts the level of the vocals “to allow them to blend with the synthesisers”. They become just another instrument, another layer of a multi-faceted song. The reasons for this new wave of creativity are hard to pinpoint. Some critics point to policy: a generous government stipend, known as the intermittents du spectacle, allows musicians to live virtually rent-free, so long as they can prove they are “active”. Since 1994, a quota that requires French radio stations to allocate at least 35% (down from 40% in 2015) of airtime to French songs has also ensured artists get the exposure they need. Others think the influence is musical, pointing to La Femme, a band that, on failing to inspire interest among labels in their own country, decided to tour America instead. Their eclectic style—often described as psychedelic 1960s surf rock—and catchy, sometimes nonsensical, lyrics, resonated with an international audience and showed other musicians in France that “it is possible to sing in French and still be cool,” says Mr Boisseguin. Others still consider the feel-good music a sort of rebellion against tragedy at home. In an interview, Phoenix, an electronic rock band, noted how after the Paris attacks in 2015 they wanted to produce a sound “that would bring light back to the city”. And just as the first “French touch” movement found fans across the globe, so too this generation of artists is finding fans far from France. Polo & Pan are selling out venues across Europe and America. The Blaze, an electronic duo, this year performed at Coachella, a star-studded festival in Palm Springs, California. Petit Biscuit, a DJ whose hit “Sunset Lover” has amassed more than 280m streams on Spotify, is halfway through a global tour. Cinema’s status as the country’s most important cultural export is under threat as French music finds a new groove.

(279, 'Labour adopts ''all'' internationally-recognised examples of antisemitism in bid to end turmoil over issue', NULL, 'Labour’s hopes of ending its summer turmoil over antisemitism have been hit by fresh criticism, despite Jeremy Corbyn bowing to pressure to recognise all internationally recognised examples. After months of prevarication the party finally announced it would adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) document, to the relief of most MPs and activists. But it also approved a statement which “ensures this will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians”. And Mr Corbyn, in a rare defeat, was forced to withdraw a further statement, because he lacked support, which argued it should not be “regarded as antisemitic to describe Israel, its policies or the circumstances around its foundation as racist”. The announcement came after debate raged for hours at a meeting of Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC), prompting suggestions that no agreement would be possible. It was quickly criticised by the group Labour Against Antisemitism, which described the “freedom of expression” statement as “a get out of jail card”. “There can be no caveats, no conditions and no compromises with racism,” a spokesman said. “The NEC has been told repeatedly that it needs to adopt the IHRA in full, without caveats or conditions, if it wants the Labour Party to begin the process of dealing with its antisemitism crisis. “It has ignored the requests of the Jewish community and denied the fundamental right of that community to define its own discrimination.” Labour Friends of Israel echoed the criticism, saying: “A ‘freedom of expression on Israel’ clause is unnecessary and totally undermines the other examples the party has supposedly just adopted.” After initially welcoming the decision, the Jewish Leadership Council accused Mr Corbyn of attempting to undermine the IHRA definition and said its first assessment was based on a disingenuous presentation of what had been agreed. Chief executive Simon Johnson said: “It has now become absolutely clear that the leader of the party attempted shamefully to undermine the entire IHRA definition. “The ‘free speech caveat’ drives a coach and horses through the IHRA definition. It will do nothing to stop antisemitism in the party. “Now that the NEC has undermined the definition, it is clearly more important to the Labour leader to protect the free speech of those who hate Israel than it is to protect the Jewish community from the real threats that it faces.” Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who branded Mr Corbyn a “racist and antisemite” in a confrontation in July, called it “two steps forward and one step back”. Nevertheless, the overall move is likely to be greeted with relief by most Labour MPs and supporters as offering hope for finally starting the process of rebuilding badly damaged trust with Jewish people. Critics will wait to see whether the adoption of the code leads Labour to take more effective action against members accused of antisemitism. The all-party Home Affairs Committee, in a 2016 report on adopting the IHRA document, recommended “additional clarifications to ensure that freedom of speech is maintained in the context of discourse about Israel and Palestine”. The Board of Deputies of British Jews did not criticise the “free speech” caveat but attacked Labour for having “wasted a whole summer trying to dictate to Jews what constitutes offence against us”. “The adoption of the internationally recognised definition by itself can only be the beginning. Action is what matters,” said Marie van der Zyl, the board''s president. “In addition, Jeremy Corbyn needs to apologise for past antisemitic comments and affiliations.” Rebecca Long-Bailey, a shadow cabinet and NEC member, defended the additional statement, saying: “We fully support IHRA, the definition and all of the examples, and we are not seeking to water them down.” But she admitted: “I think it’s a small step in the right direction. We have lost faith within the Jewish community, and we know that, and it hurts pretty much all of our Labour membership to know that we are in that state of affairs at the moment.” Before the meeting got underway, rival groups of protesters gathered noisily outside the party’s headquarters on London’s Victoria Street. Jeremy Corbyn loyalists protested against adopting all 11 International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance examples, fearing that will curb legitimate criticism of Israel’s actions. But a counterprotest of campaigners demanded full adoption, insisting Jewish people should determine what amounts to discrimination against them. In July, Labour triggered huge criticism by leaving out four of the IHRA’s 11 examples of antisemitism. The NEC statement said Mr Corbyn had promised “action against antisemitism, solidarity with the Jewish community and protection of Palestinian rights”, in a further consultation on Labour’s code of conduct. But Brandon Lewis MP, the Conservative Party chairman, said: “Adding caveats to the internationally accepted definition of antisemitism exposes Jeremy Corbyn’s continued unwillingness to take a firm stand against anti-Jewish racism.” Earlier, Labour’s attempts to end the bitter antisemitism row were further undermined by a leaked dossier cataloguing vile abuse, which was handed to Scotland Yard. The file contained incidents in which Labour members allegedly described Jews as “cancer”, claimed a prison sentence for a former Auschwitz guard was “a disgusting travesty of justice”, and said a “Zionist” MP was going to “get a good kicking”. The allegations were leaked from a meeting of Labour’s own disputes panel, which sat on 3 July, meaning that all were reported to the party’s high command by victims.

(280, 'Chaos and fury at confirmation hearing for Trump''s controversial Supreme Court justice nominee', '''I am an optimist. I live on the sunrise side of the mountain, not the sunset side of the mountain''', 'The confirmation hearing for the judge who may be Donald Trump’s single most consequential appointment, began with chaos and anger as dozens of protesters were arrested and Democrats sought to halt proceedings before they had started. It was always clear the process to confirm 53-year-old Brett Kavanaugh, the man set to become Mr Trump’s second Supreme Court appointment in less than two years, would be deeply contentious. Yet on a hot, humid day when Washington both blazed and sweated, the mood inside the air conditioned chamber on Capitol Hill where the judge made his first appearance before senators quickly, rapidly became heated and angry. Complaining that up to 42,000 pages relating to Mr Kavanaugh’s work had only been made available at the last minute, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee sought to postpone the hearing. In response, Mr Kavanaugh vowed said the Supreme Court should “never, never be viewed as a partisan institution”, and said if confirmed he would “keep an open mind in every case”. He added: "For twelve years, I have been a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. I have written more than 300 opinions and handled more than 2,000 cases. I have given it my all in every case. I am proud of that body of work, and I stand behind it. I tell people ''Don’t read what others say about my judicial opinions. Read the opinions''.” Democrats complained that they were still missing many of the documents they had been promised related to the judge''s work. “We have not been given an opportunity to have a meaningful hearing on this nominee,” said Democrat Kamala Harris of California. Another Democratic senator, Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, claimed “this process will be tainted and stained forever”. In addition to the politicians, a number of protesters, some of them wearing costumes, sought to stop the hearings, claiming that Mr Kavanaugh would destroy the rights women had battled for and won over the the past four decades. Especially eye-catching were a group of crimson-clad women dressed as characters from the recent television adaptation of Margaret Atwood dystopian novel The Handmaid’s Tale. “We want to keep the rights that women have fought for and which are under threat. Especially for women of colour who are more vulnerable,” protester Nadine Bloch told The Independent “Mr Kavanaugh wants to return things to the dark ages, take away our rights and control our bodies.” But the protests, from both Democrats and activists, had little effect. The committee’s Republican chairman Chuck Grassley, gavelled the hearing to order and the process got underway. “The committee has received more materials on Judge Kavanaugh than we have had on any Supreme Court nominee in history,” he said. He also said the contentiousness and protests surrounding Mr Kavanaugh’s confirmation, also set a new precedent. “This is something I’ve never gone through before in 15 Supreme Court nominations,” he said. Republican senator John Cornyn, of Texas, called it “mob rule”. In his opening remarks released ahead of delivery, Mr Kavanaugh sought to dampen the controversy over his nomination, which would likely shift the closely divided court to the right. He promised to be a “team player” if confirmed, declaring that he would be a “pro-law judge” who would not decide cases based on his personal views. “A good judge must be an umpire – a neutral and impartial arbiter who favours no litigant or policy,” an excerpt of his comments released by the White House said. “I don’t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. His remarks also paid tribute to Justice Anthony Kennedy, the 81-year-old justice who was frequently a swing voter on the court and whose announced his retirement in June and whose vacancy Mr Kavanaugh is seeking to fill. “To me, Justice Kennedy is a mentor, a friend, and a hero,” Mr Kavanaugh said. “As a member of the court, he was a model of civility and collegiality. He fiercely defended the independence of the judiciary. And he was a champion of liberty.” Later, when he actually addressed the committee in person, he spoke of his family, of his love of coaching his girls'' basketball team. He also said he had promoted women and minorities as his law clerks. "I am an optimist. I live on the sunrise side of the mountain, not the sunset side of the mountain. I see the day that is coming, not the day that is gone.  I am optimistic about the future of America and the future of our independent Judiciary," he said. But protesters were not persuaded. They believe that while Mr Kennedy was known as a “swing voter” who helped the court maintain a balance, Mr Kavanaugh’s confirmation would move it sharply to the right. “This is a mockery and a travesty of justice,” shouted one woman who was led away from the hearing, according to the Associated Press. “Cancel Brett Kavanaugh!” Ilyse Hogue, president of the pro-choice group NARAL said: “What’s at stake is not just abortion rights, although that would be enough. It is the relegation of women to second class citizens, which would not only hurt my daughter and all of our daughters, but hurt my son as well. Because we know a Kavanaugh court would restrict rights for everyone.” Meanwhile, just before lunch, Fred Guttenberg, the father of Parkland shooting victim, Jaime, tried - and failed - to shake hands with Mr Kavanaugh: “My daughter was murdered at Parkland.” The White House later said security had "intervened" before the judge could shake the hand that had been proffered to him. Mr Trump accusing senate critics of Mr Kavanaugh of “looking to inflict pain and embarrassment”. In a Tuesday sent after the day of opening statements, said Mr Kavanaugh was “one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress”. Mr Kavanaugh is next due to answer questions from senators. He closed his statement by saying: "If confirmed to the Supreme Court, I will keep an open mind in every case. I will do equal right to the poor and to the rich.  I will always strive to preserve the constitution of the United States and the American rule of law.” ', 'http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-justice-nominee-hearing-confirmation-a8522936.html', 'https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/04/13/brettkavanaugh-hearing3.jpg', '2018-09-04T17:20:00Z', 286, 6),
(281, 'The world’s lender of last resort is back in vogue', 'As the dollar strengthens and interest rates rise, more emerging-market governments are turning to the IMF', 'ON SEPTEMBER 4th Argentina’s finance minister will meet the IMF’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, to discuss a bail-out of the country’s creaking economy. Investors will be watching closely. Since April the peso has come under pressure from investors worried about Argentina’s large budget deficits and soaring inflation. Its government has already raised interest rates and secured a $50bn credit line from the IMF, but markets remain jittery. Last week, after Mauricio Macri, Argentina’s president, appealed to the IMF for faster disbursement of bail-out funds, the peso tumbled by 16% against the dollar. It is the world’s worst-performing currency this year. Argentina is not alone in seeking assistance from the IMF. Since the start of 2016, the fund has intervened more than a dozen times in countries in economic distress. The costs are beginning to add up. After falling for five years, total IMF lending is now 27% higher than at its low point, reached this May (see chart). It is expected to grow even more. In the coming weeks, the economic troubles of Pakistan and Ukraine may force them to turn cap-in-hand to the fund as well. Combined, their funding needs could reach as high as $15bn. Because the IMF attaches strict policy conditions to its loans, all of these governments are likely to pay a steep political price for multilateral financing. Such conditions can be hard to meet: Ukraine has already received $8.4bn from a $17.5bn IMF bail-out package agreed to in 2015, but lost access to additional funds because it failed to pass IMF-backed reforms. Mr Macri has already made promises he may have trouble keeping. After agreeing in June to cut Argentina’s primary deficit (ie, before interest payments) for 2019 to 1.3% of GDP, yesterday his government pledged to balance next year’s budget outright.

The students claim that the university has systematically chosen less qualified applicants of other races over more qualified Asian-Americans. The case reflects deep-seated divisions over affirmative action in America, where the debate revolves mainly around access to education. Affirmative action describes the practice of giving preference to members of certain groups, for example in terms of university admissions, government contracts or jobs, often in an attempt to rectify historical discrimination or persecution. In India the state uses quotas for dalits, who are the country’s lowest caste group, in government jobs and public universities. In Malaysia, affirmative action works in favour of Malays, who have historically been poorer than their Chinese and Indian counterparts. And Norway, Italy and Belgium are among countries that require a certain percentage of board members at listed companies to be women. Advocates for affirmative action believe that such policies are needed to tackle deep-seated prejudices and systemic discrimination. Opponents contend that such an approach is unfair, since two wrongs don’t make a right, and does more harm than good, as The Economist has argued. Another group believes that some people deserve a leg-up but disagree on the grounds for qualification. It’s a complicated, fraught topic. To debate it we have invited Ella Whelan, a journalist, to argue in favour of the motion, and Julia Sass Rubin, an academic, to argue against. Opening statements appear today, rebuttals are on Wednesday, and closing arguments are published on Friday. Voting is open until Sunday evening.

If I had been asked to write this statement because I was a woman, and because The Economist needed to make up its quota of female writers that week, I’d like to think that I would decline. Not because I don’t want the job, but because any pride I have in my work and my ability would stop me from doing so. Affirmative action is an insult. It suggests that individuals from certain backgrounds need a leg up to be able to achieve what the rest of society does with ease. Supporters claim that it’s a necessary evil, that until the world is a better place we need affirmative action to give minorities a space at the table. No one wants to be nominated for an award or hired for a job on the basis of their skin colour, sexuality or gender. However, until society is less intrinsically male, pale and stale, certain people should take all the help they can get. There are two problems with this view. The first is that supporters of affirmative action imagine that the world is stacked against them, and that the barriers life might throw at them are too difficult to face. As a woman, I’m often told that I might find it harder to speak up in meetings, or might shy away from asking for job opportunities because I’m too naturally polite. Anyone who has met me knows that isn’t quite the case. Despite the fact that women are excelling in all aspects of public life (even out-earning men in their twenties), I’m still considered in need of charity because of my gender. The second problem is that affirmative action underestimates how far society has come from the days of real and ugly discrimination. Fifty years ago, when life was a lot more fraught with inequality, it wasn’t handouts or leg-ups that won people their freedom, but direct action, collective organisation and radical demands for equality. When the Bristol Omnibus Company refused to employ black or Asian workers in 1963, a group of young West African and West Indian men organised a protest which boycotted the buses until they ended the discriminatory practice. As a result, the Race Relations Act was passed in Britain in 1965 which stopped racial discrimination in public places, later followed by a further act in 1968 to cover housing and employment. Likewise, the 1968 Dagenham female strikers at Ford didn’t need affirmative action to win fair pay for their work, they went on strike until they won it for themselves. We no longer live in a systematically racist, sexist, discriminatory society. We have those who fought past struggles for freedom to thank for that. And those battles that some of us still face will not be won with calls for special treatment of minorities. Supporters of affirmative action forget the power of workers, and individuals, to stand up for their rights and demand their equality. Crying for pity quotas from the big boss won’t get us anywhere. If we want to be treated like equals, we must recognise affirmative action for what it is: lazy tokenism. Ella Whelan is a columnist for spiked magazine and author of What Women Want: Fun, Freedom and an End to Feminism. Affirmative action refers to efforts to provide equal opportunity in educational admissions, employment hiring, and promotion to those of different races, ethnicities, income levels and physical abilities. Affirmative action is necessary because our society is not meritocratic. In fact, preferential treatment based on income, race and ethnicity is the norm. I write this as someone who has benefitted from those privileges. As a white, upper-middle class woman from a highly-educated family, I never had to worry about whether I would have enough to eat, a safe place to live, or would be able to see a doctor when ill. I never attended underfunded schools with unprepared teachers, inadequate textbooks, unsafe or dilapidated facilities, and fellow students who were hungry, traumatized by violence, or exhausted from holding down two jobs to help feed their families. My parents had the knowledge, time and ability to help me with my schoolwork or to open doors by connecting me with others in their social networks. Teachers and employers never assumed that I was not smart or competent because of my skin color, ethnicity or accent. These privileges provided me with many advantages over others who worked just as hard or perhaps even harder than I did but were not as fortunate. In America, we could address such inequities through public policies, as we did for a short time in the 1960s and 70s. But we are not. Instead, income inequality is increasing dramatically, further limiting access to opportunities. And because income is very unevenly distributed by race and ethnicity, growing income inequality is exacerbating America’s already substantial racial and ethnic inequalities. Affirmative action is also necessary because there is no “objective” way to compare candidates when admitting to universities or hiring for jobs. Supposedly meritocratic selection criteria actually reflect and reinforce our society’s inequities and prejudices, giving tremendous advantages to those already at the top. For example, multiple studies have confirmed that standardised test scores mirror family educational attainment and income, and that job and admission interviews are subject to numerous perceptual biases that favour in-group candidates. Since those doing the selecting are likely to be from more privileged groups, that means others like them have an edge. Only by acknowledging these biases and inequities, and structuring selection to consciously address them, can we make access to opportunities even remotely equitable. There are many reasons to support affirmative action. Diversity of experiences, cultures, and ideas brings immense benefits to classrooms and work environments. For me, however, the most compelling reason to support affirmative action is equity. As an upper-middle class white person, I have benefited from our society’s de facto affirmative action for people like me. That is not right because the family you are born into should not dictate your life chances. I  support affirmative action because I want the economic and demographic composition of an entering college class or a company’s workforce to reflect the broader population from which it is drawn rather than being skewed by privilege. I support affirmative action because everyone in our very unequal society should have an equal opportunity to succeed. Julia Sass Rubin is an Associate Professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, Rutgers University, and an Associate Visiting Professor at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University. To the proponents for scrapping I say this:\nIf you are white - are you willing to change places permanently with someone of color in this country?\nIf you are male - are you willing to trade places permanently with a woman in this country?\nThe answer will most likely be no, and no matter what amount or level of justification you stand up and deliver, the real reason is - being white, and male, comes with all the perks, and there is no way one would give that up - I know Zi wouldn’t! Are you willing to use standards that measure the ability of a student to be successful in school as a requirement for acceptance? Or do you want to include skin color as a requirement, in order to meet some self-imposed quota? Most people, including most blacks, believe that using skin color as a standard does harm to everybody, especially those being chosen. Supporting affirmative action (AA), Julia Rubin wrote, "That is not right because the family you are born into should not dictate your life chances." Rubin claims that if you are born into poverty, then you remain in poverty. That claim is a lie.  Millions of impoverished immigrants from Asia arrived in the United States before 1970.  They told their children that if they work hard in school, then they will attain a middle-class life that is far better than the lives of their parents Heeding this parental advice, millions of Asian-American children did succeed. Heeding the same advice, millions of European children whose parents immigrated to the United States in the early 1900s also succeeded. What is the problem with Africans and Hispanics?  Due to culture and genetics, they perform poorly in school — and in life.  Africans and Hispanics are solely responsible for their failure, and they do not deserve preferential treatment from AA. There is more information @ http://theclearsky.blogspot.com/2017/08/striking-hard-against-affirmativ... It is generally apparent that no society is yet free of bias and discrimination, and that efforts to create such a society must be not just continued but strengthened.  Affirmative action, however,  is identity politics in drag, and identity politics is tribalism in drag.  It is an important contributor to the current tendency of nations to fragment into communities defined by narratives of victimization, and to ensure that no meaningful discussion of deeper problems of law, culture, and  institutional bias - the remediation of which are the only thing that will lead to stable solutions to discriminatory practices and structures - can occur.  It is perhaps doubly effective in this, by reinforcing victimhood status not just of the population which allegedly benefits from affirmative action, but also creating within the "majority" a new sense of being victims themselves.  Contrary to popular argument, therefore, affirmative action is not, in fact, diversity in action.  Rather, it is probably one of the better ways to ensure that true diversity is fought across the board:  those who benefit from affirmative action will lose those benefits if they cannot continue as identifiable victims, while the majority will learn to oppose diversity because of the clumsy discrimination introduced by affirmative action programs. I don’t think we are even aware of our biases and prejudices as a society. At my job, I saw time and again white males hired and chosen over others for positions that they weren’t the most qualified for.\nNo one at my workplace, which was run by and full of white males, seemed to notice. Bringing it up branded me as a radical.\nThis is unconscious bias and the reason some sort of affirmative action is needed in my view. Here''s the problem: I have witnessed workplaces run by Black people which disproportionately promoted Black people over White people, despite the fact that many of those White people were more qualified. In modern Western society (the USA in my case), minorities are no longer subjugated to the lowliest positions and often display the same "unconscious bias" that Whites are disproportionately said to possess. This raises the questions: how do we reliably identify "unconscious bias," and is it reasonable to have AA programs work against Whites when this unconscious bias can just as easily inhibit them? My answers are "there''s no way" and "no, it''s not reasonable at all." What you "witness" is the same thing minorities witness each day in non-minority owned or managed corporations. The issue isn''t this or that specific group. It''s an issue of balances of composition and the need to continually fight against "unconscious bias" operating in any group-structure. Would you enjoy it if you were denied a job or college application simply because someone of a different skin color applied? I certainly wouldn''t. There are lower standards set for those of African or Hispanic descent, but for what? Why not hold them to the same standard? AA is essentially a bias towards minorities, despite having lower standards already set, where on of   Hispanic descent can have a 3.0 GPA and still apply and be accepted to a good college, while an Asian or European must have a GPA of above 4.0 in high school to apply to the same college. This isn''t giving those minorities a chance, it''s is purposefully limiting everyone else to give those who are entirely undeserving of those jobs and college educations, when compared to how much they have tried. Several examples of this are how, on average, European white people, Asians, and those that AA discriminates against have almost always done far better in academics and business than Hispanics and Africans. Those people do better because they try to succeed, work far harder. On the contrary, many of the Hispanics and Africans I met during high school were lacking in drive, and performed far worse than I in academics. Why give one who has no intention of learning when there are many others, with a true goal and a plan to reach it? Supporters of affirmative action (AA) claim that unequal outcomes prove the existence of discrimination. The hard truth which many scientists try to avoid or hide (via political tactics like feigned anger) is that differences in culture and genetics produce differences in behavior among different ethnic and racial groups. According to one report by "The Economist", differences in genetics produce differences in intelligence.  (reference:  http://www.economist.com/node/4032638 ) According to another report by the same journal, differences in culture produce differences in work ethic.  (reference:  http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21715998-establishing-cause-... ) That explains why Mexico, which is a Hispanic nation, is economically poor with a high rate of violent crime and why Japan is economically rich with a low rate of violent crime. There is more info @ http://theclearsky.blogspot.com/2017/02/politicization-of-science.html Professor Rubin makes a heartfelt and convincing case for giving the poor better access to high quality education--something that benefits those at all levels of society, and is necessary for a healthy democracy. But she fails to prove that discriminating amongst the poor based on skin color for the sake of racial "equality" does enough good to justify the intrinsic harm caused by violating the moral precept against racial discrimination. Clearly, being "white" is very important to her, but there are many in this society who would like to abandon once and for all these fictional, harmful categories such as "black," "white," and "colored," and just see people as people.

(284, 'British boy who has lived in country since birth refused entry to UK on return from holiday', 'Exclusive: Mohamed Bangoura, born in Leeds in 2012, blocked from reuniting with his mother in Britain after Home Office revoked his passport', 'A six-year-old boy who has lived in the UK all of his life has been prevented from returning home to his mother following a holiday after the Home Office revoked his passport. Mohamed Barrak Diallo Bangoura, who was born in Leeds in 2012, had been staying in Belgium with family friends for six weeks during the school holidays. He was due to board a flight home to his mother on Sunday, but officials at Zaventem airport in Brussels said the Home Office had instructed them he could not travel to the UK. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott described the case as “truly shocking” and said the act of blocking a UK-born child from returning home was “exactly one of the effects” of the government’s hostile environment. The Home Office said they issued a letter to Hawa Keita, the boy’s mother, who is of Guinean origin and lives in Sheffield, in March informing her that her son’s passport had been issued in error and had been “revoked” due to questions surrounding his British citizenship. But Ms Keita told The Independent she had not received this letter until it was sent to her via email when she contacted the Home Office after her son was blocked from the flight on Sunday. The letter states that the child’s claim to British citizenship was no longer valid because it had “come to light” that the man Ms Keita was married to at the time of his birth was not settled in Britain. Since a change to legislation in 1983, children born in the UK will only have British citizenship if at least one of their parents is a British citizen or is living in the UK with permission to stay in the country permanently. The boy now remains in Brussels with ​the family he was staying with, friends of his mother. Ms Keita is in the UK and unable to travel because she was residing in the country based on her son’s British citizenship. Abdoul Diallo, a political advisor for the EU who has been looking after the child in his family home in Belgium and took him to the airport on Sunday, told The Independent he was shocked when he was preventing from boarding the flight. “We went through all checks and security controls in the airport, but as we were about to board plane, the staff said British authorities had sent them email saying the child cannot board,” he said. “It was a shock. We were told to go to the British embassy, but it was Sunday and the next day was a bank holiday. I had to call the Belgian police, who gave me a document saying I should look after the child until a solution is found.” Mr Diallo said that Mohamed appeared to be relaxed about the situation so far, but warned that it may become more difficult once his friends go back to school on Wednesday, at which point he will be looked after by Mr Diallo’s mother. “We’re going to have him for one more week. He has been happily playing with my eight-year-old daughter and my nephew who is six, but they will start school tomorrow. That’s when he will start realising the situation,” he said. “Hawa is residing in the UK based on his British nationality, so she cannot leave the country, meaning for the time being the child is stuck here. No matter what the parents have done, the child shouldn’t be separated from them.” Responding to the incident, Ms Abbott told The Independent: “This case is truly shocking. That this government would preside over a system blocking a six-year old born here from returning home is almost beyond belief. “We have ministers telling us they are sorting out the Windrush scandal, and their hostile environment isn’t to blame. But this shows their reassurances are worthless. “People being refused re-entry here is exactly one of the effects of their policies. It will keep on happening until they abandon the hostile environment altogether.” Chai Patel, legal policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), called for a full and independent inquiry into "this shambles of a Home Office”, accusing the department of "stranding a young child in a foreign country, when the only home he knows is in the UK". "He was born in Leeds. It is disgraceful that he is not being allowed to return, and shows that the Home Secretary continues to have scant regard to his legal duty to safeguard the best interests of children," he added. The letter to Ms Keita from the Home Office in March stated that the child’s claim to British citizenship was no longer valid because it had “come to light” that neither she nor her husband were settled in Britain at the time of the child’s birth. “We have recently been made aware that passport number X issued on the 28/11/2017 should not have been issued,” it states. “In accordance with Section 9 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, any entitlement for British Citizenship for Mohamed would only have been able to come through you or your husband and it would appear that neither of you were settled in the UK at the time of the birth.” It continues: “I can therefore confirm that [the] passport has been revoked by Her Majesty’s Passport Office as Mohamed has no entitlement to the document.” In response, a Home Office spokesperson said: “A letter was sent to Mohamed’s mother in March advising her that her son’s passport had been revoked. We understand that despite this Mohamed was taken out of the UK in July and last Sunday was unable to re-enter as he did not hold a valid passport.​ “The Immigration Minister has asked officials to urgently look into all available options in this case to reunite Mohamed with his mother.” ', 'http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/boy-passport-home-office-belgium-holiday-blocked-mother-a8522211.html', 'https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/04/13/hawa-mohamed.jpg', '2018-09-04T14:54:00Z', 287, 6),

(286, 'Why Australia loses prime ministers', 'Not one has served a full term since 2007', 'IN THE quarter of a century to 2007, Australia had three prime ministers. Since then not a single one has survived a full three-year term. First went Kevin Rudd, a Labor leader who was replaced by his deputy, Julia Gillard, in 2010. When her popularity plummeted, he knifed her in return but lost a general election shortly after. That led to the installation of Tony Abbott, a hardline conservative, as prime minister in 2013. But he lasted only until 2015 before being toppled by the more moderate Malcolm Turnbull. Last month, following a coup fomented by Mr Abbott’s hard-right bloc, Mr Turnbull lost his job. Scott Morrison, the former treasurer, is now prime minister. That brings the total to six in 11 prosperous years. Why does Australia keep losing leaders? Its politicians can replace their bosses in a vote by party MPs known as a leadership “spill”. These can happen quickly and brutally, with the winner requiring just 50% of the vote. Spills were rare before this century, so some ascribe their increasing popularity to a modern preoccupation with opinion polls and popularity. Parties often bet that replacing a prime minister will boost support before the next election. A series of weak leaders, nursing personal vendettas, has only added to the problem. (Labor’s spills were built on the battle between Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard. Among the conservatives, Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott started attacking each other as early as 2009). “We’ve set a precedent,” observes Michael Fullilove of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank. “We are waiting for a prime minister who can break it.” Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. Other causes relate to the peculiarities of Australia’s parliamentary system. First, its three-year electoral cycle is among the shortest anywhere in the world. Prime ministers are barely sworn in before parties start thinking about the next election. Second, the Australian senate is one of the world’s most powerful. It can neuter governments that do not control it, and not many governments do. The upper house is elected by proportional representation and is now dominated by a menagerie of minor parties and independents. Third, it is compulsory to vote in Australia. Ian McCallister, a professor at the Australian National University, estimates that up to 18% of voters take part only because they have to. This cohort is drawn to style over substance, he says, and has underscored a deep culture of personality politics in Australia. The churn might be easier to understand if Australians were hard done-by. But the economy has not been in recession for 27 years. The coups are increasingly counterproductive. Australians have grown sick of the insecurity they precipitate, and profess historically low trust in their politicians. Support for the Liberals has crashed to its lowest level in a decade after the latest upheaval. But change is possible. After its back and forth, Labor installed rules in 2013 that made it harder to knife the leader. They must now be elected by both MPs and members over a month-long process that is intended to prompt deliberation. Politicians who want to force a spill must deliver a petition signed by 60% of their colleagues. (Liberal rebels, by comparison, still need only half.) Mr Rudd argued recently that the change has made it impossible to “launch a coup at the drop of a hat”. His successor, Bill Shorten, is unpopular with voters, but has survived unchallenged for almost six years. The Liberals might learn something from that.

(287, 'Deer antlers are a dual-use technology', 'They are not just for fighting other deer', 'IN MARCH 2015, braving the bitter cold of a Yellowstone winter to report on research being carried out there on wolves, your correspondent chanced upon a wolf pack as it attacked and killed a deer of the species known in North America as “elk”. (These are actually a type of red deer. True elk are called “moose” in North America.) Days later, all that remained was a bloody skeleton and a spectacular set of antlers. Dramatic as this scene was, it presented an evolutionary conundrum. Males grow antlers during the spring and summer, in order to fight one another for females during the rutting season, which is early autumn. Antlers are heavy. A full-grown male’s may weigh more than 17kg. It thus requires a lot of energy to carry them around. Yet March is many months after the rut. Moreover, the earlier a male sheds his antlers after rutting, the longer he has to grow a fresh pair for the following year’s shenanigans, and thus the bigger and more pointed those antlers can be. The conundrum, then, is why males do not dispose of these bony encumbrances immediately after the rutting season is over. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. A plausible suggestion is that they retain them for defence against predators. That has now been confirmed by Matthew Metz of the University of Montana, Missoula. In a paper published this week in Nature Ecology and Evolution he reports that male elk without antlers are indeed more likely to be both attacked by and taken by wolves. Mr Metz and his colleagues came to this conclusion by examining a database maintained by researchers for the Yellowstone Wolf Project. This recorded 55 encounters between wolves and adult male elk that had been observed by those researchers between 2005 and 2015. Helpfully, the entries noted whether the elk in an encounter had antlers. Individuals or groups that included at least one male without them were, Mr Metz found, 3.6 times more likely to be attacked than if all males present were endowed. The kills which Yellowstone’s wolves are making also suggest that antlers work as a deterrent. Mr Metz and his colleagues noted that, although only a quarter of the area’s male elk have shed their antlers by late March, these now-pointless animals make up half of the males killed by wolves. This suggests either that wolves are being fended off by animals with antlers or that they are selectively attacking those which do not have them. The effect that this predation pressure has on the animals is telling. Young males (those that are, in any case, least likely to mate) are almost always the last to shed their antlers, typically doing so in May. Their best evolutionary strategy is to survive until the following year, when they will be bigger, stronger and more likely to succeed in the mating game. Older males in good nutritional condition (those with the best shot at successful mating anyway) maximise their advantage by shedding their antlers as early as the beginning of March, in order to get a head start at growing their new ones. The increased risk of death that this entails is more than balanced by the reduced risk, which big antlers bring, of failing to contribute genetically to the next generation. Since such failure is the Darwinian equivalent of never having been alive in the first place, that is a trade worth making.

(288, 'What is Falun Gong?', 'China’s government calls it an “evil cult”', 'WALK into Chinatown in any big Western city, and on the main street you are likely to find a row of seated meditators, their legs crossed and backs straight. Seemingly innocuous, they could easily pass for participants in a yoga class. In fact, the meditators are practising a prescribed set of exercises from Falun Gong, a spiritual discipline which China banned in 1999 and calls an “evil cult”. Along with Tibetans, Uighur Muslims, democracy activists and pro-independence Taiwanese, Falun Gong practitioners round off the “five poisons”—risks which the Chinese government has acknowledged as posing the biggest threat to its rule. What is Falun Gong? Falun Gong, which means “law wheel practice” in Chinese, is a set of meditation exercises and texts that preach the virtues of truth, benevolence and forbearance. It was founded in north-east China in 1992 by Li Hongzhi, a former trumpet player. Falun Gong draws on China’s long tradition of qigong, a regimen of controlled breathing and gentle physical movements. But unlike other qigong-inspired disciplines that sprouted up in the 1990s, typically claiming nothing more than health benefits for practitioners, Falun Gong avows a path to salvation for the faithful.  Adherents would try to gain enlightenment by reading the works of “Master Li”, who is said to be able to walk through walls and levitate. By the late 1990s millions of Chinese from all walks of life had taken up Falun Gong. Practitioners could be seen meditating in parks and public squares in every city.

The party wants the undivided loyalty of China’s people, and Mr Li, a living leader, competed for that loyalty. Officials would have felt threatened by what they saw as a powerful “competing ideology”, as one Falun Gong practitioner puts it, and by the incredible growth in the number of practitioners between 1992 and 1999. In 1996 the government banned public sales of “Zhuan Falun”, the spiritual movement’s main text. Soon afterwards newspaper editorials began attacking Falun Gong, claiming it drives adherents to commit suicide. In April 1999 more than 10,000 aggrieved Falun Gong practitioners protested outside Zhongnanhai, the party’s headquarters in Beijing. In response to the provocation Jiang Zemin, China’s then president, vowed to eradicate the sect. In June 1999 he set up Office 610 (named after the date of its creation), a secretive extra-judicial party organisation tasked with suppressing Falun Gong, and the following month the government declared the sect illegal. Within months thousands of practitioners were rounded up, sent to jail or “re-education” centres. Yet despite a relentless 20-year crackdown, Falun Gong has survived. It is a much-weakened force, whose current following in China is probably only 5% of what it was at its peak, reckons Massimo Introvigne of the Centre for Studies on New Religions, a think-tank in Italy. Public meditation sessions in China have all but disappeared. But every few weeks Chinese-language media still report on newly nabbed Falun Gong practitioners, perhaps indicating a surprising resilience. And Mr Li, now in exile in America, remains active. In June he gave a speech to thousands of followers at a stadium in Washington, DC, praising practitioners in China for keeping their faith despite repression by the “evil” party. Little wonder, then, that Falun Gong is placed first on the Chinese government’s latest list of 24 proscribed evil cults.

(289, 'A court in Myanmar jails two reporters for breaking a secrecy law', 'Why did Aung San Suu Kyi not speak up for them?', 'A WEEK after a team of UN investigators said Myanmar’s most senior generals should be tried for committing genocide against the Rohingya people of Rakhine state in western Myanmar, a judge in Yangon imposed seven-year jail terms on two Burmese journalists working for Reuters news agency who had been investigating the killings of Rohingya men found in a mass grave. The reporters’ crime, the judge read, was to have been found in possession of confidential government material. This, he ruled, was a breach of the country’s colonial-era Official Secrets Act. In fact the journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, had not stolen the documents. The papers had been handed to them by police officers over dinner. The correspondents were arrested upon leaving the restaurant. Soon afterwards a spokesperson for the ruling party, the National League for Democracy, who is also a confidant of Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s de facto leader, said he thought the pair had been deliberately “set up”. Miss Suu Kyi’s civilian government does not control the armed forces or the police. But Myanmar’s then president, Htin Kyaw, another of her close allies, gave authorisation for the case to proceed. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. The sentencing concluded a farcical nine-month trial. One witness had to read out notes written on his hand in order not to forget the location where the pair had been arrested. A police officer failed to show up in the courtroom to testify. The judge fell ill. A police captain told the court that the journalists had indeed been framed. He was promptly jailed himself. No one denies that the massacre the journalists were looking into occurred—not even the army, which admitted responsibility and claimed it had jailed seven soldiers for their involvement. But a few days later Myanmar’s public broadcaster said the soldiers were free again. When the foreign press got hold of the story of the release a spokesperson for the government dismissed it as “false news”. The authorities do not allow foreign journalists to travel freely to Rakhine state, where the army’s brutal response to an attack by Rohingya rebels prompted an exodus of over 700,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh. The government has set up a series of committees to investigate allegations of atrocities by the army, but several foreigners invited to sit on them have quit, describing them as whitewash. The head of the latest inquiry said its job was not to apportion blame. Saddest of all has been the reaction of Miss Suu Kyi. She has refused to defend the two journalists and has parroted the prosecution’s case. She has also failed to speak up for the Rohingyas, a mostly Muslim group that many of her Buddhist supporters deem a threat to their country and religion. She may have decided to adopt this stance in order not to upset the army, fearing that antagonising it might derail the country’s democratic transition for which she battled for so long. But if Burmese journalists end up in jail for trying to uncover the truth about an alleged genocide conducted on her watch, that raises questions about how committed to democracy she really is.

(290, 'China is sprucing up its pharma sector', 'The changes are helping multinational drugmakers. In time they may boost the domestic industry', 'CHINA is home to 1.4bn people. The population is ageing, and thus more vulnerable to ailments. Sustained economic growth is making the country richer, and more able to afford remedies. To foreign pharmaceutical firms, this looks like a winning combination. They are less keen on protracted review times, onerous rules and the reams of paperwork required to sell drugs in China. It can take a decade after approval in America for foreign drugs to reach Chinese patients. The Chinese authorities at last appear to have acknowledged the problem—and are administering a cure in doses that have surpassed even optimists’ expectations. A reinvigorated regulator is waving through drugs from abroad, and clamping down on unscrupulous domestic companies. The government is spending more on drugs, including foreign ones, as it expands public health care. It is letting market forces weed out frail local firms. In other words, China is becoming a more normal market. Global drugmakers are rubbing their hands. By some estimates China became the second-largest global consumer of medicines in 2017. The market is worth $122.6bn, according to IQVIA, a research firm. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. The normalisation owes a lot to the overhaul of the China Drug Administration (CDA). Under Bi Jingquan, who took over the regulator in 2015, the CDA introduced fast-track review for drugs for unmet medical needs, ditched the requirement to perform clinical trials with Chinese patients in state-run Chinese labs and relaxed rules that obliged many firms to invest in local factories. The CDA has also joined a global body which harmonises the way drugs are assessed. It is adopting international standards for the collection of clinical data. In three years Mr Bi accomplished what would normally take three decades, gushes Lu Xianping, the co-founder of Chipscreen Biosciences, a Chinese biotechnology firm. For foreign drugs firms this means quicker and cheaper drug approvals. The approval in March last year of AstraZeneca’s lung-cancer drug, Tagrisso (osimertinib), came seven months after regulators in developed markets gave theirs—“a very different timeline” compared with the past, confirms Sean Bohen, head of global medicines development at the British firm. On August 20th Roche, a Swiss company, secured Chinese consent for its own lung-cancer drug, Alecensa (alectinib), less than nine months after it launched in the West. As well as these regulatory changes, China’s national insurance scheme has expanded to cover most citizens. Although patients remain on the hook for part of the cost of the priciest treatments, the government is coughing up for more high-end drugs. In May the government extended patent protection for pharmaceuticals by five years, to as much as 25 years. It also removed import tariffs on cancer drugs and cut it on other medicines, despite trade tensions with America. The Chinese authorities do demand steep discounts on the prices of expensive treatments. Across 36 premium drugs that were included on the national reimbursement list last year, producers had to swallow price cuts of 44% on average, relative to the previous year’s average prices, calculates IQVIA. But firms are making up for lower margins with mammoth volumes. Deutsche Bank reckons that in the first quarter of 2018, the top 20 global pharma firms saw Chinese sales grow by 18% compared with last year. This was chiefly thanks to newly approved drugs. Big Pharma thus has reason to cheer the shake-up; local drugmakers less so. Chinese producers of low-quality copycat drugs have been slow to meet the CDA’s tougher new manufacturing standards and the requirement to prove that their pills are biologically equivalent to the original drugs. Unblocking the backlog of 22,000 applications for approval for sale (by foreign and domestic firms) will stiffen competition, which weaker firms may struggle to withstand. A programme to verify clinical-trial data appears to have curbed flaky applications. Mr Lu thinks that in the next five to ten years, half of China’s 4,000 pharma companies could die as a result of the changes. That appears to be the point. Hong Chow, general manager of Roche in China, reports that she has heard a government official say: “Better short-lived pain than a long one.” The tough love is meant to let laggards wither and innovators flourish. It is having an effect: perhaps 50 local generics firms are transforming into research-driven ones and more biotechnology companies are being founded, often by Chinese returning from stints at foreign companies. A decision by the Hong Kong stock exchange earlier this year to allow firms to list before they turn a profit will encourage Chinese biotech startups to seek capital at home rather than abroad. In the longer term that should spell stiffer competition for foreign drugmakers. Mr Bohen says that it is only a matter of time before a Chinese discovery in basic science leads to a new drug sold by a Chinese firm. Mark McDade of Qiming Venture Partners, a big health-care investor in China, points to top-notch Chinese research in cancer therapies known as CAR-T. The number of molecules approved for clinical trials in China has ballooned (see chart). The speed of change is not guaranteed. Developing new drugs is an uncertain, lengthy process. Mr Bi, the regulator who championed drug quality, was ironically one of those forced to resign in August after hundreds of thousands of children were discovered to have been given ineffective vaccines. Reforms to the CDA still have a long way to go. The agency has only just begun harmonising its rules with those of foreign counterparts. The goal of having 289 generics pass bioequivalence tests by the end of the year is optimistic. Franck Le Deu, a senior partner with McKinsey, a consultancy, foresees a period of uncertainty following Mr Bi’s sudden departure. The direction of reform is unlikely to change but its pace or focus might, he notes. That in turn will determine how long the boom times last for foreignpharma firms in China.

(291, 'Central bankers grapple with the changing nature of competition', 'This year’s Jackson Hole meeting was a chance to study market concentration', 'RECENT visitors to Jackson Hole, a resort in the Teton Mountain range in Wyoming, were denied the usual scenic views by a shroud of smoke from recent forest fires. Disappointing, no doubt, for the tourists among them—but oddly fitting for the economic panjandrums attending the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual symposium on August 23rd-25th. Not only are economic policymakers used to making choices in a fog of uncertainty, but this year’s theme of market structures generated its own haze. Though the nature of competition in America’s economy is changing, it is unclear how worried they should be. Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, highlighted slow wage growth in recent decades. America seems stuck in a “low-productivity mode”, he said. Others pointed to sluggish investment, despite cheap capital, and a fall in workers’ share of national income. Could these ills share some common causes, namely rising market concentration and crimped competition? Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. As evidence, Alan Krueger of Princeton University pointed to nominal wage growth that is 1-1.5 percentage points lower than would normally be expected with inflation and unemployment as low as they are now. He laid some blame on employers’ growing power, as no-poaching agreements and non-compete restrictions proliferate, on sickly union membership and on the falling real value of the federal minimum wage. Antoinette Schoar of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) remarked that a banking shakeup by fintech upstarts, long predicted, has not fully materialised. Rather than turning new firms into viable competitors, venture capital seems to have nurtured them only for incumbents to gobble them up. As markets have become more concentrated, observed John van Reenen, also of MIT, the gap in productivity between the biggest and smallest companies has widened. If something is stopping substandard firms from closing the gap, that could be sapping the economy’s dynamism. These concerns fit into a dark story, of an economy weakened by behemoths abusing their market power. But there is a competing narrative. Consider the Jackson Hole conference itself, stuffed with star academics and policymakers. Is it an incumbent monopolist, resting on its reputation as the year’s hottest macroeconomic event? Or is it a shining example of the power of network effects, convening great minds to produce ideas jointly that surpass anything they could dream up separately? Rising market concentration, Mr van Reenen pointed out, might reflect not a decline in competition, but a change in its nature. Platforms such as Google, Uber and Airbnb match buyers and sellers, and thus make outsize gains as they grow. In such winner-takes-most competition, a slight advantage can tip the entire market in a company’s favour. Mr van Reenen finds that America’s rising economic concentration is mostly caused by big, productive companies gaining market share. Far from growing complacent and fat, they seem impressively muscular. Other observations chimed with this narrative. Alberto Carvallo of Harvard University showed that the prices of goods sold in brick-and-mortar shops vary less by location and are updated more often if they are also sold by online rivals. Prices of shops’ products were much more likely to reflect changes in exchange rates if the same items were sold on Amazon. Such cost-sensitivity is hard to square with the idea that competition is lacking. The differences between these rival narratives matter for economic policymakers. In one version nefarious market forces are constricting productivity, holding down investment and wages. If so, that would make the trade-off between inflation and unemployment harder to manage. In the other, restrained investment and wages are signs of structural changes that boost productive potential—in which case, there would be fewer ill-effects from running the economy hot. Unsurprisingly, given the number of economists assembled, the only point of agreement was on the need for more evidence. Part of the difficulty is that the two narratives are not as distinct as they appear. As Janice Eberly and Nicolas Crouzet of Northwestern University pointed out, the same forces could be creating both competition-harming barriers to entry and rising productivity associated with economies of scale. They find a correlation between a company’s market share and its investment in patents, algorithms and other intangible capital. Moreover, the impact on competition seems to vary by industry. In retail and manufacturing, although concentration and intangible investment have risen, the researchers’ measure of price markups has stayed low. By contrast, in the high-tech and health-care industries, they find an association between intangible investments and markups. Even as sophisticated logistical algorithms sharpen the battle between the likes of Amazon and Walmart in retailing, in other words, a proliferation of patented devices and databases full of customer insights could be enabling market leaders in pharmaceuticals and finance to shut rivals out. Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago offered another reason to wait before declaring increased economic concentration either good or bad for the economy overall. Even if superstar companies are passing efficiency gains on to consumers now, they may not keep doing so indefinitely. If they continue to be boosted by the trends behind economic concentration, from stellar returns to amassing troves of customer data and the increasing sophistication of proprietary software, their pricing forbearance may not last. Once their dominance is secure, they could turn predatory, milking consumers and squeezing innovative potential from the broader business environment. The economy has changed a lot in recent years—and there is no reason why it cannot keep changing.
