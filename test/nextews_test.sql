                                         (LAPD) The officer asked the driver to exit the car, at which point he could be seen pulling out a .380-caliber handgun and firing just inches from the officer. She could be seen falling to the ground and her partner-- who was at the passengers’ side-- returns fire, mortally wounding gang member Richard Mendoza, 32, according to Fox 11. Our latest Critical Incident Video is from an Officer-Involved Shooting that occurred on July 27, in which an LAPD Officer was shot at point-blank range during a traffic stop. The officer survived & the suspect died from gunshots. Link to entire video ➡️ https://t.co/AiIE7p28Ac pic.twitter.com/h4alCk6Lzf The Los Angeles Times reported that Mendoza was hit multiple times in his head a torso and died later at a nearby hospital. The shooting occurred in Mission Hills in the San Fernando Valley at about 10:15 p.m., the report said. The female officer was hit in the leg. She is recovering, police said. The report said the LAPD has been releasing videos from “critical incidents.” “By the grace of God she is alive,” LAPD Chief Michel Moore told the paper. “Officers are fearful in these situations and the public here gets to see why. “Once a person has you in that position it is very tough,” he said. “You cannot stop that first one or two shots.” Retired LAPD Sergeant Mike Sayre told Fox 11 that the video is a good example of how quickly police officers have to respond. "So, that means you have to be able to identify a problem, react to it and neutralize it within 3 seconds. That’s quick.” Edmund DeMarche is a news editor for FoxNews.com.

INSERT INTO `news` VALUES (2,'What is the GRU?','It has been linked to the annexation of Crimea and the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, but its power could be waning','IN THE pantheon of Russian intelligence, the KGB is king. It fills the ranks of cinematic and literary villains, from John Le Carré’s spymaster Karla to the sleeper agents of “The Americans”, a TV show. But a different set of spies is now hogging the limelight. The GRU, the intelligence arm of Russia’s armed forces, has been caught up in almost all the crises involving the country in recent years, from the annexation of Crimea, to the downing of a passenger aircraft over Ukraine, to the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, a former spy, in Salisbury. Who are these hyperactive military spooks? The Bolsheviks created a military intelligence service in the earliest days of the Soviet Union, settling on the name GRU (from the Russian for “Main Intelligence Directorate”) in 1942. While the agency that became the KGB (“Committee for State Security”) was housed in striking headquarters close to the foreign ministry, earning the label “near neighbours”, the GRU became the “distant neighbours”, exiled to a small, shabby house much further away. Yet by the end of the second world war, it had penetrated Britain’s atom-bomb programme and over 70 American institutions. During the cold war, it cropped up at key moments. It was a GRU officer who formed a backchannel with Robert Kennedy, the president’s brother and America’s attorney-general, during the Cuban missile crisis. Another was at the heart of Britain’s Profumo scandal a year later. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor''s Picks. The KGB, now split into the security-focused FSB and outward-looking SVR, had the fame. But the GRU could boast of closer ties to revolutionary movements and terrorist groups, greater experience with weapons and explosives, and even tougher training for recruits. A book published in 1986 by Vladimir Rezun, a GRU defector, described a film shown to new spooks; it depicted a traitorous officer, lashed to a stretcher, being fed into a crematorium alive. Competition between the services was intense. When the KGB learnt of an audacious British operation to tap Soviet communications by digging a tunnel into East Berlin, it did not bother to tell the GRU that 25 of its telephone lines had been compromised for over a year. The rivalry was so fierce, writes Jonathan Haslam, a historian, “that operatives of the one were not even entirely safe from the protégés of the other”. The GRU was starved of funds and slashed in size after Russia’s war with Georgia in 2008, when it failed to detect that Georgia had got hold of new anti-aircraft missiles. But its special forces subsequently played a pivotal role in seizing Crimea and supporting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. GRU hackers, dubbed “Fancy Bear”, ran riot in cyberspace, penetrating everything from Germany’s parliament to Emmanuel Macron’s campaign for the French presidency. But some of these activities proved embarrassing. In May, Bellingcat, an investigative website, unmasked the name of a GRU officer involved in the downing of a Malaysian Airlines flight over Ukraine; the hapless spy had sent online shopping to the address of the GRU headquarters. Two months later, Robert Mueller, America’s special counsel, exposed the names, ranks and addresses of a dozen GRU hackers. Such occasional missteps may not deter an organisation whose ethos is to take risks, but it has other reasons for worry. In recent years, it is thought to have suffered from heavy defections. Mass expulsions have decimated the ranks of Russian spies under diplomatic cover in the West, making operations harder. And Britain has hinted at cyber-attacks on GRU communications and finances. The time may have come for James Bond to take on a GRU villain in the franchise’s next film.

Payments through the airline’s website and mobile app were stolen over the three week period, but a key clue was that travel information wasn’t affected. Yonathan Klijnsma, a threat researcher at RiskIQ, suspected it might be the same group that was behind the Ticketmaster breach, in which hackers targeted a third-party that loaded code on Ticketmaster’s  various sites. From there, it could siphon off thousands of transactions. This time, Klijnsma said the group took an even more “highly targeted approach,” describing a wave of attacks that the “Magecart” collective has used to steal thousands of records from various sites in recent months. “This British Airways attack was just an extension of this campaign,” he said, prior to the release of his research. His research, out Tuesday, points to hackers injecting code directly onto the company’s website which the airline used shared on both the website and the mobile app. Using his company’s proprietary web crawling technology, he found that code hosted on the airline’s global site was compromised on August 21 — the reported date of the breach — and malicious code was injected without anyone noticing. When a customer clicked bought plane tickets, the code would scrape the credit card information the open payment page and forward the data to a fake site run by the hackers from a private server in Romania. Names, billing address, email address, and all bank card details were collected by the code. “This attack is a simple but highly targeted approach compared to what we’ve seen in the past with the Magecart skimmer which grabbed forms indiscriminately,” said Klijnsma. “This particular skimmer is very much attuned to how British Airway’s payment page is set up, which tells us that the attackers carefully considered how to target this site instead of blindly injecting the regular Magecart skimmer.” That would explain why the financial data was collected but not the travel and passport data. It also explains why the mobile app was affected, Klijnsma said, because an analysis of the mobile app also loaded the same data-scraping script. “There’s so many ways they could have stolen the payment or [personal] information, they went for this really simple method, but its super effective,” said Klijnsma. But, he said, “they went from super advanced to simplifying their attacks — and their [returns are] more insane than ever.” British Airways spokesperson Liza Ravenscroft declined to comment citing an ongoing criminal investigation.

The round is led by BlackFin Capital Partners, while existing investors Amadeus Capital Partners, Passion Capital, and Playfair Capital followed on. In a call with co-founder and CEO Martin Sweeney, he told me the new funding will in part be used for Ravelin’s  expansion plans. This will include opening an office in the East Coast of the U.S., where the company is seeing increasing in-bound inquiries. This, he says, won’t merely be one or two sales people, but will be staffed properly, including posting one of Ravelin’s other co-founders there. The company has also recently developed a product for Payment Service Providers, and says it will continue to invest in other capabilities complementary to its core of charge back protection proposition. These will include account security and risk prediction. Launched in 2016, Ravelin’s has developed machine learning-based technology that helps online merchants and their payment service providers reduce losses to fraud and improve acceptance rates of orders. The idea is to do away with cruder, rule-based systems and use machine learning to negate false positives and give merchants more confidence accepting customers/transactions. More broadly, Ravelin wants to be an invaluable tool in fighting chargebacks, account takeovers, organised fraud rings and terms of service abuse, which  the company says continues to be a multi-billion dollar problem for the online commerce industry. Sweeney tells me the future aim is to be able to identify different patterns of risk to personalise the customer journey accordingly. For example, a more riskier transaction may introduce more friction in the checkout process as more security hurdles are introduced. Likewise, a less risky customer could encounter fewer steps, helping to increase conversions. To that end, in the last year businesses such as eShopWorld, Just Eat, Kinguin, and Quiqup have joined Ravelin’s existing enterprise clients. “There is no greater endorsement of our approach than the companies we’ve been able to add to our portfolio,” adds Sweeney in a statement. “We’re proud that many of the world’s leading online businesses have chosen to work with us. We’ll continue to serve them well”.

On ''The Ingraham Angle,'' Bannon addresses the anonymous NYT op-ed and Trump''s relationships with members of his administration. Bannon, who left the White House last year, went on to decry the “absolutely outrageous” anonymous New York Times op-ed and urged the Trump administration to find out who were responsible for it. “I mean, there is a coup, like saying there was a coup by General McClellan and his senior leadership in the Union Army to try to thwart what Abraham Lincoln wanted to do in the civil war. You have the exact type of coup right now,” he added, referring to a Union Army commander during the Civil War who was fired by Lincoln for refusing to follow orders. “What was said in that anonymous letter was absolutely outrageous. And I think the president ought to make immediate and direct action to find out who the conspirators are,” he said. He added that though “White Houses are naturally … cauldrons of different opinions,” most anonymous anti-Trump voices are holdovers from “the Bush administration” or “establishment Republicans.” Last Wednesday, the New York Times published a bombshell opinion article written by “senior official” at the Trump administration, who lamented the president’s leadership style. The op-ed describes a secret inside plot to protect the nation from Trump’s “misguided impulses” and said there were “early whispers” of a possible Cabinet coup to remove Trump out of office using the 25th Amendment. “This isn’t the work of the so-called deep state,” the author of the opinion article wrote. “It’s the work of the steady state.” Trump said Friday he knows “four or five” people who could be responsible for the article in the newspaper.

Text, iMessage or WhatsApp your videos, photos and stories to CNN: 347-322-0415 Wilmington, North Carolina (CNN)The southern East Coast of the United States is bracing for the arrival of Hurricane Florence as the storm -- already packing winds of up to 140 mph -- neared Category 5 strength Tuesday. More than 1 million people face mandatory evacuation orders in coastal areas of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. One year after major storms ravaged the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico, officials warned those in Florence''s path not to underestimate the threat the storm poses. Residents boarded up their homes, formed long lines at gas stations and emptied the shelves of hardware stores and supermarkets Monday. As of 11 p.m. ET Monday, Florence had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. "Some strengthening is expected during the next 36 hours, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday," the NHC said. The storm is forecast to strengthen to near Category 5 and "there remains high confidence that Florence will be a large and extremely dangerous hurricane, regardless of its exact intensity," the National Hurricane Center said. A Category 5 storm has sustained winds of 157 mph or more. National Guard soldiers are being mobilized in the affected states. President Donald Trump declared an emergency in North Carolina, allowing it to access federal funds. Six more North Carolina counties were placed under mandatory evacuation Monday night, hours after the first order in Hatteras Island. Certain areas of Brunswick, Currituck, Dare, Hyde, New Hanover, and Onslow counties are affected, and more orders are expected Tuesday. In South Carolina, mandatory evacuation orders take effect Tuesday at noon in eight counties along the state''s 187-mile coastline. Starting then, all roads on I-26 and Route 501 will be directed away from the coast, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said. "This is a real hurricane we have coming," McMaster said Monday. "We don''t want to risk one South Carolina life." State government offices, including schools and medical facilities, will be closed in 26 counties, McMaster said. He estimated that about 1 million people will be affected by the order, including residents and visitors. In Virginia, mandatory evacuations begin 8 a.m. Tuesday for about 245,000 residents in a portion of Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore area, Gov. Ralph Northam said Monday. "Everyone in Virginia needs to prepare," he said. "This is a serious storm and it''s going to affect the entire state of Virginia." Residents of coastal areas boarded up homes and packed their bags as they braced for Florence''s arrival. Lines formed at gas stations as people heeded warnings to gas up in case they''re ordered to leave. Crystal Kirwan didn''t think she had much choice as she got her family ready to leave their home Monday. She and her husband will make the 4.5-hour drive with their children to family in Dover, Delaware, as soon as he is cleared from military duty. "Probably not too much better, but most likely safer than here," she said. Grocery stores began selling out of water, milk and bread, and supply stores were struggling to stock batteries, plywood and generators as early as Sunday. At a Home Depot in Wilmington, North Carolina, Billy Nivens told CNN they ran out of water, plywood, generators, flashlights, propane, batteries and five-gallon gas cans by Monday afternoon. Ryan Fonville visited three hardware stores in Wilmington Monday and found that they were running out of supplies. "I gathered my supplies this weekend, sharing for local community groups so people don''t waste gas. The gas pumps are running out as well," Fonville told CNN. Since noon Sunday, a Lowe''s in Lumberton, North Carolina has been sold out of generators, store manager Mackie Singletary said. In Charleston, South Carolina, the Coburg Dairy Cow landmark was removed for safekeeping from its perch atop a sign on Highway 17 on Monday, according to CNN affiliate WCIV. Florence became a hurricane Sunday with sustained winds of at least 74 mph. By Monday morning, the hurricane center classified Florence as a "major" Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds of at least 111 mph. It was picking up speed over the Atlantic''s warm waters, causing concerns about landfall and flooding from heavy rains afterward, possibly late Thursday or Friday. Track the storm and compare different forecast models About an hour after the Category 3 upgrade, the storm was reclassified once again, now as Category 4. That means sustained winds of at least 130 mph and expectations of catastrophic damage, the hurricane center says. States of emergency were declared in the Carolinas, Virginia and Maryland. In Maryland, where some coastal areas are still recovering from weather, Gov. Larry Hogan said flooding could be catastrophic if it hits the state. "We are hoping for the best and preparing for the worst," Hogan said. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper urged residents to prepare for lengthy power outages after the hurricane arrives and learn evacuation routes they may need to take. "North Carolina is taking Hurricane Florence seriously, and you should, too," Cooper said. "Action today can avoid losses due to Florence." Two other storms also are churning in the Atlantic.

Renesas produces microprocessor and circuits that power devices, and automotive is its core focus. It is second only to NXP on supply, and more than half of its revenue comes from automotive. IDT, meanwhile, includes power management and memory among its products, which focus on wireless networks and the converting and storing of data. Those are two areas that are increasingly important with the growth of connected devices and particularly vehicles which demand high levels of data streaming and interaction. The acquisition of IDT — which is being made a 29.5 percent on its share price — is set to expand Renesas’ expertise on autonomous vehicles. The firm said it would also broaden its business into the “data economy” space, such as robotics, data centers and other types of connected devices. Renesas has already demoed self-driving car tech, which puts it into direct competition with the likes of Intel . Last year, the firm paid $3.2 billion to buy up Intersil, which develops technology for controlling battery voltage in hybrid and electric vehicles, and IDT deal pushes it further in that direction. “There’s little overlap between their product portfolios, so it’s a strategically sound move for Renesas. But it does seem like the price is a little high,” said Bloomberg analyst Masahiro Wakasugi. The IDT deal has been on the table for a couple of weeks after Renesas first revealed its interest in an acquisition last month. It is expected to close in the first half of 2019 following relevant approvals.

INSERT INTO `news` VALUES (13,'Who will be believed: Trump or Woodward?','President Donald Trump has called Bob Woodward''s new book "Fear" a "fraud." But Woodward''s track record with the truth is better than Trump''s.','WASHINGTON — Bob Woodward isn''t a "left-wing hack." He didn''t deceive or betray anyone to get access to the White House. And while his methods have drawn scrutiny and criticism in the past, his reporting on power has been the gold standard ever since he and Carl Bernstein broke Watergate. That''s why his new book "Fear" appears, ironically, to have struck such fear in the heart of its subject, President Donald Trump. Of all the government and media institutions and players Trump has attacked since he first launched his campaign for the presidency in 2015, Woodward could be the toughest to discredit. There''s even a Trump tweet for that. Only the Obama WH can get away with attacking Bob Woodward. "There''s a war on truth by him," Woodward said on the "Today" show Monday morning, adding that the president''s former lawyer, John Dowd, concluded Trump shouldn''t testify in special counsel Robert Mueller''s Russia probe "because he can''t tell the truth." Disregarding his own observation, Trump has launched a sustained attack on Woodward and the book, which hits stores Tuesday. It "is a total fraud," Trump said on Air Force One last week. "The book that was written was fiction. I don''t speak that way. I''m highly educated and always did well." "This detailed account shows a president whose own advisers are desperate to protect the American people from the chaos he creates, and makes it clear that the biggest obstacle facing the president’s agenda is often the president himself,” said Michael Steel, who was an aide to then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Steel worked extensively with Woodward when the author was reporting for "The Price of Politics," a book about President Barack Obama''s dealings with Congress. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday that on-the-record pushback on Woodward from administration officials should be given more weight than the accounts of unnamed figures used by Woodward. While there will be a tendency in Washington to treat the book as a warmed-over reiteration of long-understood dynamics within the administration — Trump''s top lieutenants see him as both an "idiot" and a danger to the country — the book is powerful both for giving a unique Woodward credence to the narratives of authors Omarosa Manigault-Newman and Michael Wolff and for new nuggets that could turn off Trump voters, particularly those who sided with him but are not part of his solid bloc of about 35 percent of voters. What will Southerners, adherents of "rule of law" Republicanism and families of people with disabilities make of Woodward''s report that Trump mocked Attorney General Jeff Sessions'' Alabama accent and called the nation''s top law enforcement official "mentally retarded" and a "dumb Southerner?" "Never used those terms on anyone, including Jeff, and being a southerner is a GREAT thing," Trump wrote. But Trump''s disdain for Sessions, so often articulated in his own Twitter feed, is as legendary as Woodward''s ability to get everyone to talk. And Trump has called people "mentally retarded" before. With that context, it isn''t hard to believe he called Sessions a "dumb Southerner," too. What will the populists make of Woodward''s report that Ivanka Trump, denying her official role as a White House aide, told Steve Bannon that she was above staff work? "I''m not a staffer! I’ll never be a staffer," the younger Trump fumed. "I’m the first daughter." There likely won''t be a moment when Trump''s base turns against him. His base is rock-solid, and it has stuck with him through calamities that would have destroyed any other politician. But for Trump to win in 2020, and for Republicans to hang onto both houses of Congress in November, a lot of voters who are neither part of his base nor viscerally repulsed by him will have to decide whether they want him to gain or lose power. Woodward''s detail about Trump''s handling of policy — the fear he created at the Pentagon and among top Cabinet officials with his itches to upend American relationships abroad, for example — is at once less sexy than name-calling, whether he''s the target or the launcher of personal invective, and more important to the question of whether he ought to be checked or even defeated at the ballot box. In a New York Times op-ed, an anonymous senior White House official wrote that "the dilemma — which he does not fully grasp — is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations." Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has become a Trump ally, pointed to Woodward''s credibility on that front Thursday, even as he said some of the book should be taken with a grain of salt. "The whole theme of the book is that President Trump can run hot and be volatile," Graham said. "I agree." Even denials from White House chief of staff John Kelly and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, based on specific passages in the book, felt rote. Kelly denied saying the president is an "idiot" and Mattis said he''d never heard anyone in his orbit — including himself — use "contemptuous" language about the president. It''s not unusual for Washington figures to deny reporting that is true if it is politically disadvantageous to them, even if they are the source — "happens frequently," Woodward said on "Today." NBC News reported on Kelly calling Trump an "idiot" in May. It would be unsustainable for him to continue in his job as chief of staff if he didn''t deny using that term to describe the president. But neither he nor Mattis dared to launch a real counterattack on Woodward, who records most of his interviews. Both of them commented in written statements, rather than rushing to cameras to defend their honor or the president''s. Typically, that wouldn''t be a huge problem for a president who has been able to cast past books and news reports as the work of people with axes to grind, money to make or simply a bias against him. But Woodward? He''s wealthy enough that he doesn''t need another best-seller to sustain himself. He didn''t turn his back on Trump like Manigault-Newman or blend into the background of a new White House staff like Wolf. And he''s detailed the good, the bad and the ugly of presidential decision-making without regard for the party or political agenda of the commander in chief since before many White House aides were born. "Woodward has always had his detractors, but there’s no question that he is relentless in his research and incredibly effective in getting people — lots of people — to talk, and in great detail," Jeff Shesol, a speechwriter in the Clinton White House and an author of political nonfiction books. "Everything I’ve read about [the new book] suggests that he has once again put together a mosaic of multiple impressions and recollections that add up to an indisputable truth: in this case, that Trump is utterly, disgracefully, dangerously unfit for the job he’s got." If there''s a credibility gap, Woodward is usually on the right side of it. That''s according to Trump — or, at least the 2013 Trump.

INSERT INTO `news` VALUES (15,'Doctors gave no reason for a third of opioid prescriptions, study finds','About a third of opioid prescriptions written from 2006 to 2015 were given to patients without explanation in their medical records, a new study finds.','Doctors gave no good reason for prescribing opioids to patients close to a third of the time during the buildup to the opioid overdose epidemic, researchers reported Monday. A close check of medical records from 2006 to 2015 showed that a physician gave no explanation at all for writing an opioid prescription in 29 percent of the cases, the team at Harvard Medical School and the Rand Corp. found. The findings help support criticism by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and others that say inappropriate prescribing practices have helped drive the opioid crisis, in which 42,000 people died in 2016 alone. The CDC has been trying to get doctors to prescribe opioids only when absolutely necessary, and to prescribe as low a dose as possible for the shortest time possible. Nicole Maestas, a professor of health care policy at Harvard, and her colleagues went through tens of thousands of medical records, focusing on more than 31,000 physician surveys that included a prescription for an opioid. Two-thirds did include a pain diagnosis: usually back pain, arthritis, diabetes or other chronic condition. Five percent were for pain related to cancer. “No pain diagnosis was recorded at the remaining 28.5 percent,” the team wrote in their report, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Many patients had multiple ailments, so the researchers threw out any surveys that may have simply lacked space to record all the diagnoses. Still, many patients got renewals of opioids for no apparent good reason. “At visits with no pain diagnosis recorded, the most common diagnoses were hypertension, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol), opioid dependence and ‘other follow-up examination,'' ” the researchers wrote. The number of opioid prescriptions rose dramatically over the past 20 years, and the CDC says people would do better with other painkillers, or even just ice. Since there’s been a big national focus on the crisis, prescribing has dropped, but not enough, the CDC says. At the very least, doctors need to write down why they are giving someone an opioid, the researchers said. “Whatever the reasons, lack of robust documentation undermines our efforts to understand physician prescribing patterns and curtails our ability to stem overprescribing,” Dr. Tisamarie Sherry, who worked on the study, said in a statement. Meanwhile, a second study showed that most teens and young adults who have opioid use disorders are not getting the medication they do need. Drugs such as buprenorphine, naltrexone and methadone can help people fight their addiction to opioids. But the team at Boston Medical Center found that only 24 percent of youths with an opioid use disorder had a prescription for one of the drugs. “In this multistate study of addiction treatment and retention in care, we found that three-quarters of youths diagnosed with opioid use disorder received treatment within three months," the team wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association’s JAMA Pediatrics. "However, most treatment included behavioral health services only, and fewer than one of four youths received timely buprenorphine, naltrexone or methadone treatment." Many doctors don’t know about the drugs; there’s stigma around their use and it can be hard to get methadone especially, the researchers noted. People with opioid use disorder are far more likely to drop out of treatment and relapse if they don’t get Food and Drug Administration-approved drug treatment, the researchers noted.
